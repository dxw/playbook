When [planning research activities](/user-research/creating-and-using-research-plans/), you must consider the safety and wellbeing of participants, colleagues, researchers and others.

This guidance explains how to identify and manange potential risks.

Note that this guidance applies to all dxw staff, dxw friends, and partner and client staff doing research activities, like interviews, visits, surveys and tests.

## Doing research safely during coronavirus

We have a responsibility to keep ourselves and our participants safe and comply
with government guidance during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. In
particular, we should carefully consider whether and how to do any face to face
research.

For now, you will need the approval of a Director, Head or Principal Researcher
to do face to face research. And you must document your decision and your
assessment of the risks in your
[research plan](#how-we-create-and-use-research-plans).

The Service Manual has a guide to
[choosing face to face or remote research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/doing-user-research-during-coronavirus-covid-19-choosing-face-to-face-or-remote-research),
and what to include when you document your decision and your assessment of the
risks.
