## Doing research safely during coronavirus

We have a responsibility to keep ourselves and our participants safe and comply
with government guidance during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. In
particular, we should carefully consider whether and how to do any face to face
research.

For now, you will need the approval of a Director, Head or Principal Researcher
to do face to face research. And you must document your decision and your
assessment of the risks in your
[research plan](#how-we-create-and-use-research-plans).

The Service Manual has a guide to
[choosing face to face or remote research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/doing-user-research-during-coronavirus-covid-19-choosing-face-to-face-or-remote-research),
and what to include when you document your decision and your assessment of the
risks.
