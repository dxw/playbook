title: Choosing and using research methods
permalink: /:path/:basename/

Our fourth research principle is to [Be methodical, but not rigid](https://playbook.dxw.com/user-research/#user-research-principles). At dxw, we don’t have a fixed set of approved research methods. But when we [plan our research](https://playbook.dxw.com/user-research/creating-and-using-research-plans/), we do need to choose appropriate methods for the context and apply them well.

We prefer tried and trusted methods that can provide strong evidence and reliable answers to our questions, for the least time, effort and cost.

And we always consider a team’s level of experience with user research. So we may prefer simpler methods like interviews and usability testing that the team can easily understand and join in with.

This guide lists our favourite books, articles and videos for different research methods. Provides links to any tools and templates we have created. Along with good examples from previous projects.

## Human centred research and design
At dxw, we follow human centred design practices to Start with people and their needs.

##Interviews
Interviews are a flexible way to learn more about different types of users, including their circumstances, previous experiences, motivations and needs from services.

Choose interviews when:
- your research is broad and you don’t yet know which topics will be most relevant or which questions will be most useful
- the subject is complicated, will require some explanation and participants are likely to give you long and detailed answers
- you want the chance to ask follow up questions to fully explore and better understand what participants tell you

You can combine interviews with usability testing, by talking to participants to understand previous experiences and current use, before asking them to try out a prototype or service.

## Contextual research and observation
Contextual research means visiting people in their everyday environment (like their home, work or school) to observe how they do an activity.

Watching someone complete a task in familiar surroundings with their own equipment (and usual distractions) can help us better understand how they use an existing service, what does and doesn’t work well for them, and what they might need from a future service.

Choose contextual research and observation when:
- you want to see how people do things in a real-life context using their own data, documents and devices
- you want the chance to ask questions about the barriers or problems people experience, and the different ways they try to overcome them
