title: Choosing and using research methods
permalink: /:path/:basename/

Our fourth research principle is to [Be methodical, but not rigid](https://playbook.dxw.com/user-research/#user-research-principles). At dxw, we don’t have a fixed set of approved research methods. But when we [plan our research](https://playbook.dxw.com/user-research/creating-and-using-research-plans/), we do need to choose appropriate methods for the context and apply them well.

We prefer tried and trusted methods that can provide strong evidence and reliable answers to our questions, for the least time, effort and cost.

And we always consider a team’s level of experience with user research. So we may prefer simpler methods like interviews and usability testing that the team can easily understand and join in with.

This guide lists our favourite books, articles and videos for different research methods. Provides links to any tools and templates we have created. Along with good examples from previous projects.

## Human centred research and design
At dxw, we follow human centred design practices to Start with people and their needs.
