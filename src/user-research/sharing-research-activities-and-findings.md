We regularly share descriptions of research activities and findings in show and
tells, reports and other places.

This guidance covers ways to share research documents and outputs, and protect participant privacy in the process.

Note that this guidance applies to all dxw staff, dxw friends, and partner and client staff doing research activities, like interviews, visits, surveys and tests. Particularly the section on [Protecting participant privacy](#protecting-participant-privacy).

## Slide layouts for research

When presenting about research, we use one of the dxw Proposal Deck Templates.
These have all the kinds of slide layouts you will need.

You can find these in the Google Slides
[Template Gallery](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/?folder=0AGsaGhY-i-mIUk9PVA&ftv=1).

## Presenting research activities

When sharing what we plan to do or what we’ve been doing, we talk about research
activities rather than research methods.

Descriptions of research activities look like:

We did *some kind of research* with *some kinds of participants* to learn
*something the team needs to know*.

We avoid using research jargon that our colleagues might not understand. For
example, rather than talking about ‘ethnography’ or ‘contextual enquiry’ we
might say that “we visited the support desk and observed the team helping people
with their applications”.

## Presenting research findings

When sharing findings, we always make the finding the headline. Then follow up
with supporting evidence, explanation and illustration.

You can read more about this in the
[Sharing user research findings guide](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/sharing-user-research-findings#presenting-your-findings)
in the Service Manual.

## Protecting participant privacy

We are careful to [protect our participants’ privacy](/user-research/recruiting-participants-and-protecting-privacy/#protecting-participant-privacy) when we share research activities and findings.

By default, we share only fully anonymised findings, that do not include any personal data or anything that could identify a participant.

We only share more with the [properly informed consent](/user-research/getting-informed-consent-for-user-research/) of our participants.
