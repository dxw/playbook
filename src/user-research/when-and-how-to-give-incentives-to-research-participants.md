It‘s normal to pay members of the public an incentive when they take part in
research activities with us.

This guidance explains how we agree incentives with clients and pay incentives
to participants.

It builds on the
[basic guidance on giving incentives](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/find-user-research-participants#giving-incentives)
in the Service Manual.

## Who gets incentives

We will normally pay incentives to members of the public, including people who
use a government service for their work. Professionals and members of groups may
not be comfortable with getting an incentive themselves, and may want the
incentive given to their organisation or donated to charity.

We do not expect to pay incentives to our clients‘ staff or to other public
servants who take part in research related to their work.

When we are paying an incentive, make sure the participant knows the amount of
the incentive and how they will receive it. Include this in the \[information
sheet](link to consent guidance).

## Agreeing incentives

It’s best to include estimates of incentives and other research expenses in the
statement of work.

You can then confirm the exact incentive with the client when you are planning a
batch of research.

On previous project we have paid:

* £30 of Love2Shop vouchers for 1.5 hours of in-person usability testing
* £50 cash for geographically-specific users to take part in 1 hour of remote
  mobile usability testing
* £100 cash for an hour-long discovery research session with people likely to
  need assisted digital support
* £100 cash for 45 minute research session with small businesses

## Confirming incentives at the start of the research session

Handle the incentive at the start of the research session - either giving the
incentive, or confirming that the incentive will be sent. This avoids any
suggestion that participants have to ‘earn’ their incentive. It also means you
don’t have to deal with the incentive if you want to stop a problematic session.

## Paying incentives through a recruitment agency

If you are using a recruitment agency, ask them to pay the incentive to the
participant. They will know how they do this. They may charge a small fee for
handling the incentive.

If a participant contacts dxw to say they haven’t received their incentive,
apologise and contact the agency to let them know.

## Paying incentives using shopping vouchers

Where we are paying the incentive, we use shopping vouchers. Normally from
[Love2shop](https://www.highstreetvouchers.com/gifts/love2shop-gift-vouchers).

Request the amount of vouchers you need through the
[\#help-purchasing](https://dxw.slack.com/archives/C8ZGR2Y8Z) Slack channel and
[purchasing form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdz8-Z-fcootRS6UyceXbxdSdbO4-2jIyRrHHiI-3VH4LyRrw/viewform).
They should be in £5 and £10 denominations so they are easier to spend.

In a face-to-face research session, give the vouchers to the participant and
have them
[sign a receipt](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-O9Qvp4kgs4t0JfQTIQF9dkiexv5mZtPNJfcxtmODZ0).

For a remote research session, ask for the vouchers to be posted or emailed to
the participant. When posting vouchers, enclose the vouchers with a signed
[thank you sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=142Sf1QYH9wcySPf6GIOskv5qyJlc9phGZSeoCsxCoeU).

## Other ways to pay incentives

Other options for paying incentives might be a donation to a preferred charity,
or a hamper that can be shared with a team.

## Withholding incentives

We do not pay the incentive (or any recruitment fee) if the participant doesn’t
show up for their session. Although we might still pay the incentive if the
participant tries to attend, but is stopped by an emergency or severe travel
problem beyond their control.

If a recruitment agency provides a participant who does not match the brief, we
will pay the participant their incentive, but we will not pay the agency their
recruitment fee.
