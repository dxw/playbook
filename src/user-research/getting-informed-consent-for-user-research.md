You must have informed consent from participants before you start any research
activity with them. And you must then act only within the consent the
participant has given.

This guidance explains how we collect and keep evidence of informed consent at
dxw. It builds on the general guidance on
[getting informed consent](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research)
in the Service Manual.

## Creating consent materials

### Using dxw or client consent materials

There are two basic options:

1. The simplest and best option is to use our client’s existing consent
   materials. If they don’t have any, we can work with the client to create
   consent materials for the project, that the client can then reuse in future.

   In this case the client will manage all the research data we collect and keep
   the associated records of consent.
2. If using the client’s consent materials is not possible, or if the client
   asks us to do confidential research, we can use the dxw
   [information sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19lm5_gzzqzVP0NnNZZiqPhEwW2_i2bkI5apAaie4-4M)
   and
   [consent form](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k)
   templates.

   In this case dxw will manage the research data and keep the associated
   records of consent.

Which ever approach you take, make sure your consent materials and process
follow the
[good practice for informed consent](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research#what-informed-consent-is)
described in the Service Manual.

### Creating an information sheet

For each round or batch of research you do, you should create a specific
information sheet that describes the research you are doing, and gives the
participant the information they need.

You can use the same information sheet for several rounds or batches of
research, as long as you are:

* doing the research for the same purpose
* doing the same things during the sessions
* collecting the same research data
* working with the same third-party organisations and suppliers

We have
[template information sheets](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19lm5_gzzqzVP0NnNZZiqPhEwW2_i2bkI5apAaie4-4M)
to use for the most common research situations.

### Creating a consent form

If you are using a client’s consent form, make sure it clearly describes dxw’s
involvement in the research, and how we will share research data and findings.

We have
[template consent forms](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k)
for the most common research situations.

If none of the standard consent forms will work for the research activities you
are doing, speak to the Head of User Research.

## Sharing your consent materials and process

Some clients and stakeholders will not understand the ethical and legal reasons
for getting informed consent, and will not be familiar with good consent
practice.

To avoid problems later, share your consent materials and process as soon as you
can with the client and with any organisations whose staff or members you are
researching with.

## Collecting consent

### Providing the information sheet

Give each participant a copy of the information sheet when they are being
recruited for a research session. Check which format and channel works best for
them - email attachment, paper letter, easy read, etc.

For a face to face research session, make sure you can provide a paper copy of
both the information sheet and the associated privacy statement/privacy policy,
if a participant asks for one.

### Face to face research sessions

For user research sessions where you meet the participant in person, you can:

* give the participant a printed copy of the consent form
* send the consent form in an accessible digital format the participant can read
  using their assistive technology
* read the consent form aloud

Check with the participant which format works best for them.

Give the participant the consent form as soon as you can. Make sure they have
time to read it carefully, and an opportunity to ask questions, before you ask
the participant to sign .

### Remote or telephone research sessions

For user research sessions where you will not meet the participant face to face,
you can:

* attach the consent form to an email in an accessible digital format
* send a paper consent form in the post

Ask the participant to send a reply, confirming their consent. They can reply to
the email, or post back a signed paper consent form.

### During the session

At the start of the session, remind the participant that their participation is
voluntary and they can stop or take a break at any time. Remind the participant
about the different ways you are recording the session, and about anyone
observing or listening in. Ask the participant to confirm their consent for the
recording.

As the session continues, actively make sure you have the participant’s consent.
For example, check in with the participant if they look concerned about an
activity, or if you’re on a visit and want to take a photo in a new area.

## Keeping a record of consent

For paper consent forms, scan or photograph the signed consent form and keep the
image file in the folder with the research data you collect in the session.

For email responses, keep a copy of the consent form and of the participant’s
reply in the folder with the research data you collect in the session.

Make sure the consent form, email reply and any research data have the same
participant identifier. Do not include participant names or other personal
identifiers in the document names.
