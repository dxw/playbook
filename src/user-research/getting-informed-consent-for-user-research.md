You must have informed consent from participants before you start any research activity with them. And you must then act only within the consent the participant has given.

This guidance explains how we collect and keep evidence of informed consent at dxw. It builds on the general guidance on
[getting informed consent](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research)
in the Service Manual.

## Using dxw or client consent materials and processes

On different projects you might use dxw branded consent materials and follow our processes, or use consent materials provided by the client and follow their processes.

There are three basic options:

1. Use dxw consent materials and processes.

   In this case, we will use our own [templates]
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k/) to create dxw branded consent materials.

   And we will manage the research data, and keep the associated records of consent.

2. Use our client’s consent materials and processes.

   In this case, we will use the client's templates to create consent materials.

   And follow the client's processes to manage all the research data we collect and keep the associated records of consent.

   This is only possible with client organisations that have established research practices.

3. When we are working with a client to build their research capability, we can also help them to create their own consent materials and processes to use in future research activities.

Whichever approach we are taking, make sure your consent materials and processes follow the [good practice for informed consent](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research#what-informed-consent-is) described in the Service Manual.

## Collecting and keeping consent records

### Providing a research information and consent sheet

Give each participant an information and consent sheet, that describes the research you are doing, and gives the participant the information they need to give informed consent

Provide the information and consent sheet when the potential participants are invited to take part in your research. And again when each participant is booked in, and you send them details of their specific session.

Check which format and channel works best for them - email attachment, paper letter, easy read, etc.

### Collecting a record of consent

You will need to collect a record of their consent from each participant, and keep it along with their research data.

For user research sessions where you will not meet the participant face to face, you can:

* ask the participant to reply by email confirming their consent
* send a paper consent form in the post for the participant to sign and return

For user research sessions where you meet the participant in person, you can also:

* give the participant a printed copy of the consent form to sign
* share a consent form in an accessible digital format the participant can read and respond to using their assistive technology
* read the consent form aloud and collect their consent on a recording

Whichever approach you are taking, make sure the participants have time to read the research and consent information carefully, and an opportunity to ask questions.

### During the session

At the start of the session:

* remind the participant that their participation is voluntary and they can stop or take a break at any time
* remind them about the different ways you are recording the session, and about anyone observing or listening in
* ask them to confirm their consent for the recording

As the session continues, actively make sure you have the participant’s consent. For example, check in with the participant if they look concerned about an activity, or if you’re on a visit and want to take a photo in a new area.

### Keeping a record of consent

For email and similar responses, keep a copy of the research information and consent sheet you used, along with a copy of each participant's reply, in the folder with the research data you collect.

For paper consent forms, scan or photograph the signed consent form and keep the image file.

Make sure the research data and associated consent records have the same participant identifier. Do not include participant names or other personal identifiers in the document names.

## Creating consent materials

### Creating a research information and consent sheet

For each round or batch of research you do, you should create a specific information and consent sheet, that describes the research you are doing, and gives the participant the information they need.

You can use the same information sheet for several rounds or batches of research, as long as you are:

* doing the research for the same purpose
* doing the same things during the sessions
* collecting the same research data
* working with the same third-party organisations and suppliers

We have [template information and consent sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k/) that will work for most research activities.

If you are following our client's consent practices, they will provide the template to use. Make sure the sheet you produce  clearly describes dxw’s involvement in the research, and how we will share research data and findings.

If the available templates do not work for the research activities you are doing, speak to the Head of User Research.

### Creating a printed consent form

If you are doing face to face research, you may want to use a printed consent form.

We have [template consent forms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k/) that will work for most research activities.

### Creating consent materials for fully confidential research

We also have a [template consenyt materials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k/) for fully confidential research activities.

In fully confidential research, our client does not learn the identity of our participants, has no access to research notes, recordings or other data, and is not involved in analysis. They receive only fully anonymised findings.

## Sharing your consent materials and process

Some clients and stakeholders will not understand the ethical and legal reasons for getting informed consent, and will not be familiar with good consent practice.

To avoid problems later, share your consent materials and process as soon as you can with the client and with any organisations whose staff or members you are researching with.
