When we do research, we must carefully manage participants’ contact details and
other personal data to protect their privacy and comply with the law.

This guidance explains how we collect and use information about research
participants at dxw. It builds on the general guidance on
[managing participant privacy](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/managing-user-research-data-participant-privacy)
in the Service Manual.

## Collecting only the participant details we need

We collect as little information about participants as possible. And only the
information we really need to manage their participation. For example,
collecting just the participant’s name and email address to arrange a video
call.

When we use a screening questionnaire, we ask only the questions we need to
select participants. For example, we don’t ask for a date of birth if we only
need an age range.

We avoid keeping participants’ personal details as a record of who we spoke to,
or to manage subject access or deletion requests. We may keep counts of numbers
and types of participants, but these should not include any personal details.

## Storing participant details securely

We usually store participants’ details in the Google Drive folders for the
relevant project, for example in a spreadsheet in a Research subfolder. We limit
access to just the colleagues who need to use them to help people participate.

The Google Drive Help Centre has a useful guide on ways to
[stop, limit, or change sharing of files and folders](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494893).

When using an online questionnaire tool to recruit and screen participants,
transfer the responses from the tool to Google Drive as soon as possible, and
securely delete the original responses from the tool.

When sending calendar invites to participants, we restrict access to the guest
list so that only colleagues involved in the research will see participants'
contact details.

We avoid sharing email conversations that include participants’ contact and
other personal details.

And we avoid sharing participants’ details in any other tool, such as Slack or
Trello.

## Deleting participant details when no longer needed

We delete participants’ details from Google Drive, Gmail and Calendar as soon as
we no longer need the details to manage their participation in research.

Labelling emails exchanged with participants is a good way to find and delete
them. For example, in Google Gmail you might create ‘Participant’ and ‘RODA’
labels and search for them using ‘label:(participant RODA)’.

Identifying calendar events that might contain participants’ details is not so
easy. In Google Calendar you can create a personal Research calendar and add all
research activities involving participants to that calendar. Or you might adopt
a naming convention such as ‘Research:’.

## Doing fully confidential research

We sometimes do research where the participants are known only to the
researchers. Other members of the team will not know who participated in the
research.

When doing fully confidential research:

* we strictly limit access to participant details
* use private meeting invites
* share only fully anonymised findings
