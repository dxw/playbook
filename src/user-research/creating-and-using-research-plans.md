## Planning research activities

Itâ€™s important that we carefully plan the research we do.

Teams create the best services when research activities provide reliable answers
to their most important questions. And we do our best research when we do it in
ethical, inclusive and sustainable ways.

We want to involve our colleagues and other stakeholders in creating research
plans, so they understand and can contribute to research activities.

And we want to create plans that allow us to [learn, share and adapt](..) as we
go.

The guide to
[planning user research for your service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/plan-user-research-for-your-service)
in the Service Manual sets out a good approach to creating a plan.

## Research plan template

Creating and sharing a short research plan document is a great way to get
everyone aligned. And to address any concerns that clients and stakeholders may
have.

We have a
[research plan template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11olKOHluGXL8OA-XKIvSXXsCxQ3dvOUgSUgJSw0qLm4/)
that you can use as a starting point. But feel free to adapt it and add sections
that may be important for your project.
