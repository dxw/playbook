Good user research depends on recruiting appropriate participants.

This might mean recruiting:

* members of the public with experience of a particular life event, like bereavement
* small business owners who claim a particular tax relief, like an investment allowance
* public servants who review and make decisions about applications, like those for visas

We make sure that our recruitment practices are inclusive and accessible, so that we don’t exclude groups such as disabled people, and people with other protected characteristics.

And we carefully manage participants’ contact details and other personal data to protect their privacy and comply with the law.

Note that this guidance applies to all dxw staff, dxw friends, and partner and client staff doing research activities, like interviews, visits, surveys and tests.

## Following our client’s practices

When we are following our client’s practices in how we [manage research data](/user-research/taking-care-of-research-data/), we will
usually also follow their practices in how we recruit participants, and how we manage their contact and other personal details.

Check with your delivery lead if you’re not sure which practices we have agreed to follow.

## Recruiting research participants

This guidance explains how we recruit participants for research at dxw. It builds on the general guidance on [Finding participants for user research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/find-user-research-participants) in the Service Manual.

### Planning for recruitment costs

As soon as we know what they might be, we make sure that likely recruitment costs and elapsed time are covered in the budget and schedule for a project.

### Using a recruitment agency

We often use specialist agencies to recruit members of the public.

We do not have any agreements with preferred agencies. But we have had good experiences of using:

* [People for Research](https://www.peopleforresearch.co.uk/)
* [Roots Research](https://rootsresearch.co.uk/)
* [Bunnyfield](https://bunnyfield.com/needparticipants/)

## Protecting participant privacy

This guidance explains how we collect and use information about research participants
at dxw. It builds on the general guidance on
[managing participant privacy](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/managing-user-research-data-participant-privacy)
in the Service Manual.

### Collecting only the participant details we need

We collect as little information about participants as possible. And only the
information we really need to manage their participation. For example,
collecting just the participant’s name and email address to arrange a video
call.

When we use a screening questionnaire, we ask only the questions we need to
select participants. For example, we don’t ask for a date of birth if we only
need an age range.

We avoid keeping participants’ personal details as a record of who we spoke to,
or to manage subject access or deletion requests. We may keep counts of numbers
and types of participants, but these should not include any personal details.

### Storing participant details securely

We usually store participants’ details in the Google Drive folders for the relevant project, for example in a spreadsheet in a Research subfolder. We limit access to just the colleagues who need to use them to help people participate.

The Google Drive Help Centre has a useful guide on ways to [stop, limit, or change sharing of files and folders](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494893).

When using an online questionnaire tool to recruit and screen participants, transfer the responses from the tool to Google Drive as soon as possible, and securely delete the original responses from the tool.

We avoid sharing email conversations that include participants’ contact and other personal details.

And we avoid sharing participants’ details in any other tool, such as Slack or Trello.

### Managing participant details in calendars

We avoid sending calendar invites to participants, as they contain participants’ personal details and can be hard to find and delete latest.

Where we do include participants in calendar invites, we restrict access to the guest list so that only colleagues involved in the research will see participants’ contact details.

We sometimes use tools like [Calendly](https://calendly.com/), to manage participant scheduling and invitations. We limit access to the events and participant details stored in the tool.

### Deleting participant details when no longer needed

We delete participants’ details from Google Drive, Gmail and Calendar as soon as
we no longer need the details to manage their participation in research.

Labelling emails exchanged with participants is a good way to find and delete
them. For example, in Google Gmail you might create ‘Participant’ and ‘RODA’
labels and search for them using ‘label:(participant RODA)’.

Identifying calendar events that might contain participants’ details is not so
easy. In Google Calendar you can create a personal Research calendar and add all
research activities involving participants to that calendar. Or you might adopt
a naming convention such as ‘Research:’.

### Sharing research activities and findings

We are careful to protect our participants’ privacy when we
[share descriptions of research activities and report on our findings](user-research/sharing-research-activities-and-findings/).

By default, we share only fully anonymised findings, that do not include any personal data or anything that could identify a participant.

We only share more with the [properly informed consent](/user-research/getting-informed-consent-for-user-research/) of our participants.

### Doing fully confidential research

We sometimes do research where the participants are known only to the
researchers. Other members of the team will not know who participated in the
research.

When doing fully confidential research:

* we strictly limit access to participant details
* use private meeting invites
* share only fully anonymised findings
