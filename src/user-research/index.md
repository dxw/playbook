At dxw, we believe in [starting with people and their needs](https://playbook.dxw.com/who-we-are/#start-with-people-and-their-needs).

As user researchers, we help multidisciplinary teams learn about all the different people who will use and be affected by a service. And help organisations to recognise the value of user research.

There is no single right way of doing this, but as an organisation, we need to be consistent in the way we approach, do, and talk about research.

Note that this guidance applies to all dxw staff, dxw friends, and partner and client staff doing research activities, like interviews, visits, surveys and tests. And particularly the guidance on [Doing research safely](/user-research/doing-research-safely/), [Getting informed consent](/user-research/getting-informed-consent-for-user-research/), [Protecting participant privacy](/user-research/protecting-participant-privacy/) and [Taking care of research data](/user-research/taking-care-of-research-data/).

## User research principles

Our principles are not rules. They guide our work, keep us improving as a team, and working with, not for our clients.

1. **Help teams understand and value people**

   Researchers at dxw help our teams to build a deep understanding of the people who use our services, and to value and act on that understanding. We know that’s the best way we can help teams make good decisions and create public services that work well for the people who need them.

   We are facilitators, not gatekeepers. We actively involve our colleagues and clients in research. And openly share what we do, how we do it and why it’s important.

2. **Find the truth. Tell the truth**

   Researchers at dxw create strong evidence and reliable answers so our teams
   can act with confidence. We are bold and focus on what’s most important.

   We know we can learn things that are unexpected and challenging. So we
   communicate clearly and sensitively to help everyone make the best decision.

3. **Take ethics seriously**

   Researchers at dxw know that the safety and trust of participants is our
   responsibility. We think about the ethics of our research at every step. From
   how we recruit participants and get their informed consent, through how we
   store and use the data we collect, to how we share our findings.

4. **Be methodical, but not rigid**

   Researchers at dxw know that the quality of our findings depends on the
   quality of our methods. We use tried and tested methods, and take time to
   reflect and continually improve our practice.

   But we also understand that context is important. So we use the best approach
   for the question at hand and adapt our ways of working to fit the client and
   the project.

5. **Learn, share and adapt**

   Researchers at dxw work in an agile way. We do research and analysis in small
   batches so we can continuously share and adapt to what we learn.

6. **Make research inclusive**

   Researchers at dxw know how important it is that public services work for all
   the people who need to use them. We help teams understand the needs of all
   their users, and do research activities that everyone can participate in.

7. **Build on existing evidence**

   Researchers at dxw help our clients build on the knowledge and data they already have.

   We know how much we strengthen our findings when we properly use and acknowledge previous work. So we combine existing knowledge, poorly understood data and our new research into a coherent picture.

8. **Accept and admit constraints**

   Researchers at dxw do the best research we can within the constraints we
   have. We acknowledge and share the limits of our research and our findings.
   And we advocate for more research when it‘s needed to achieve the project
   outcomes.

We have a version of these [user research principles as a printable poster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YUu9sUZM8aLUxMsJsOuZacQKRbA3P7ZH0Ic4HEORaxs/).

## User research guidance

The Playbook includes detailed guidance on
[how we do user research at dxw](/user-research/how-we-do-user-research/).

These guides start with the [user research workflow](https://playbook.dxw.com/user-research/how-we-do-user-research/#user-research-workflow), which describes the things that user researchers usually do on projects, and then provides further guidance and links to resources for specific topics.

## User researcher professional development

We have
[a set of worksheets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p01dpMFEKKRE8rV9hJZ2II3I6z5BG5GbrHzPBLSaJzM/)
to help researchers with professional reflection and to inform learning and
development plans. They cover overall design skills, our principles and workflow, and our most common research methods.
