Itâ€™s important that team members and stakeholders know they have the right
research plan, discussion guide or other research document.

So we give our documents consistent file names like:

* YYYY MM DD - TYPE - CLIENT - PROJECT - RESEARCH ACTIVITY (if needed for
  clarity)

For example:

* 2019 10 01 - Research plan - Southwark - Affordable homes monitoring alpha

And a consistent front cover with:

* Client and dxw logos
* Client and project names
* Document type
* Date
* Main contact (who wrote it)

For example:

* Southwark Council
* Affordable homes monitoring alpha
* User research plan
* (Draft)
* 1 October 2019
* John Waterworth
