We create discussion guides to help us plan and do research activities, like
interviews, visits, workshops and usability tests.

They help us to:

* identify the purpose of the research activity and what we want to get from it
* review planned activities with team members and stakeholders so we stay
  aligned with project goals
* stay on track during research sessions
* make sure different researchers cover the same topics so participants have a
  consistent experience
* keep a record of what we did in each research activity

## The parts of a discussion guide

### Introduction

This part recaps the goals of the project and the research activity, describes the methods
we’ll be using, and sets out the overall structure of the research session.

### Preparation

This part describes anything the researchers need to have or do, to prepare for the
session. It references things like the information sheet to send to participants,
describes how to set up a prototype we’re be testing, and references the
[notes template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MAUax08jwwqNd1BWfH-gixSbltY2qE-m)
observers should use.

### Welcome

This part sets out the things we’ll tell the participants, so they know what’s
going on and feel ready. We often write this
out word for word, so we have something to fall back on when we’re tired, or
get interrupted or distracted.

In a good welcome we:

* **Say thank you** - We start off by letting the participants know we appreciate
  them offering their time (incentivised or not)
* **Introduce ourselves** - We let them know our name, role, and company, and who we
  are working for
* **State our relationship to the client** - We are **independent
  researchers**, working on behalf of a client
* **Summarise the research purpose** - We explain what we’re trying to find out,
  e.g. We’re interested in how you recruit teachers for your school
* **Remind them it is voluntary** - They can choose to stop at any time
* **Reassure them that there are no right or wrong answers** - We’re interested
  in how the participants think and what influences that
* **Ask them to be honest** - As researchers we won’t be offended by negative
  comments, we just want to find out what people really think about a service
  and how it might be improved
* **Describe how the session will go** - Let the participants know who is taking
  notes or observing, how we are recording the session, how long the session
  will take, and what we’ll be doing in that time, so the participants knows
  what to expect
* **Check consent and non-disclosure** - Has this been done? Do they have any
  questions?

### Topics, tasks and activities

We have a section in our guide for each of the main interview topics, test tasks
or workshop activities.

For each one we write out:

* What we are trying to learn
* For an interview topic, the starter questions we’ll ask along with likely
  follow ups
* For a test task or workshop activity

  * the steps to do
  * explanations and instructions for participants, such asking them to think
    out loud during a test so we can understand what’s happening
* How long the topic, task or activity is likely to take
* The priority - is this essential, or could we leave it out if we’re short of
  time

### Wrap up

Describe how we’ll conclude the session with the participants.
This can include asking the participants for their final thoughts, asking them
how the session went for them, letting them know what will happen next, and
thanking them for their time.

Also include any steps for the researchers, like collecting and storing
recordings, or deleting data from prototypes.

## Three discussion guide templates

We have template discussion guides for three different kinds of research
activities:

* [Interviews and contextual research](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XeBhmQL0jqFFsl2Cw-DOKVpabTRILGl-TjeyUDW90vM)
* [Usability tests](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hcVkLGJVDB9ZOoMIz93erUpk1RUgXN_ZcZflJxsFpHw)
* [Workshops](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZHZwLBnUlDsxrvv1qj_ZpFU9QGsP_dIDLMVcGbEYswY)
