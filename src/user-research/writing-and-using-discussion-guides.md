We create discussion guides to help us plan and do research activities, like
interviews, visits, workshops and usability tests.

They help us to:

* identify the purpose of the research activity and what we want to get from it
* review planned activities with team members and stakeholders so we stay
  aligned with project goals
* stay on track during research sessions
* make sure different researchers cover the same topics so participants have a
  consistent experience
* keep a record of what we did in each research activity

## The parts of a discussion guide

### Introduction

Recap the goals of the project and the research activity, describe the methods
you’ll be using, and set out the overall structure of the research session.

### Preparation

Describe anything the researcher needs to have or do, to prepare for the
session. Reference things like the information sheet to send to participants,
describe how to set up the prototype you’ll be testing, and reference the
[notes template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MAUax08jwwqNd1BWfH-gixSbltY2qE-m)
you want to use.

### Welcome

Set out the things you'll say to the participant to let them them know what’s
going on and make sure they feel comfortable. It can be helpful to write this
out word for word, so you have something to fall back on when you’re tired, or
get interrupted or distracted.

In your welcome you should:

* **Say thank you** - Start off by letting the participant know you appreciate
  them offering their time (incentivised or not)
* **Introduce yourself** - Let them know your name, role, company and who you
  are working for
* **State your relationship to the client** - We are **independent
  researchers**, working on behalf of a client
* **Summarise the research purpose** - Explain what you’re trying to find out,
  e.g. We’re interested in how you recruit teachers for your school
* **Remind them it is voluntary** - They can choose to stop at any time
* **Reassure them that there are no right or wrong answers** - We’re interested
  in how the participant thinks and what influences that
* **Ask them to be honest** - As researchers we won’t be offended by any
  comments, we just want to find out what people really think about a service
  and how it might be improved
* **Describe how the session will go** - Let the participant know who is taking
  notes or observing, how you are recording the session, how long the session
  will take, and what you’ll be doing in that time, so the participant knows
  what to expect
* **Check consent and non-disclosure** - Has this been done? Do they have any
  questions?

### Topics, tasks and activities

Have a section in your guide for each of the main interview topics, test tasks
or workshop activities.

For each one write out:

* What you are trying to learn
* For an interview topic, the starter questions you’ll ask along with likely
  follow ups
* For a test task or workshop activity

  * the steps to do
  * explanations and instructions for participants, such asking them to think
    out loud during a test so you can understand what’s happening
* How long the topic, task or activity is likely to take
* The priority - is this essential, or could you leave it out if you’re short of
  time

### Wrap up

Describe how the researcher should conclude the session with the participant.
This can include asking the participant for their final thoughts, asking them
how the session went for them, letting them know what will happen next, and
thanking them for their time.

Also include any steps for the researcher, like collecting and storing
recordings, or deleting data from prototypes.

## Three discussion guide templates

We have template discussion guides for three different kinds of research
activities:

* [Interviews and contextual research](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XeBhmQL0jqFFsl2Cw-DOKVpabTRILGl-TjeyUDW90vM)
* [Usability tests](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hcVkLGJVDB9ZOoMIz93erUpk1RUgXN_ZcZflJxsFpHw)
* [Workshops](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZHZwLBnUlDsxrvv1qj_ZpFU9QGsP_dIDLMVcGbEYswY)
