## Why our team’s work is important

Everything we do contributes to raising dxw’s profile with the people we want to work with, and aligns with our sales activity. It reinforces what’s unique about us in the public digital space. Things like the fact that we’re employee-owned, we work in expert multidisciplinary teams, and the social value we provide.

Our PR work, blogging and case studies show our projects, leadership and expertise for clients. They also promote dxw as an employer across the different specialisms, and with people with historically marginalised identities.This helps to support recruitment and increase the diversity of the team.

## How we work with the wider dxw team

Most of our activity involves working with colleagues from across dxw. Whether it’s supporting people to speak at events, pair writing, reviewing and publishing case studies and blog posts or organising our winter and summer parties.
