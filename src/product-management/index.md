## Product management principles

Product managers at dxw follow these principles.

1. **Set the destination, don’t chart the course**

   Product managers help empower multidisciplinary teams by refining and
   articulating the problem the team is trying to solve, and the outcomes
   they‘re trying to produce.

   Communicating the vision and goals for a project through a clear and
   well-maintained roadmap is a core part of product management.

2. **Define and defend scope**

   Getting agreement from everyone involved is crucial to successful delivery.

   Product managers should set the direction at the start of a project, and
   continue to articulate, communicate and defend the scope throughout, so that
   the team can focus on delivering.

3. **Convert insight into action**

   User research helps inform our objectives, goals, and priorities by telling
   us more about the problems users are having with the current state, or the
   needs they have for something different.

   Product managers need to be able to balance user research insights with
   constraints like time, capacity, and strategic objectives to prioritise the
   next most important thing.

   Product managers help the team to work together, across disciplines, to
   identify potential solutions before choosing a way forward.

4. **Have a service mindset**

   Product managers recognise that a digital product is often not the whole
   solution to a problem, and that the people operating a new service day to day
   are users too.

   We think about the processes and systems around a product, including how
   those might change.

5. **Communicate clearly how short term outcomes contribute to long term goals**

   Product managers need to own and articulate a vision that is consistent and
   meaningful to everyone with an interest in the project, from the delivery
   team all the way through to the most senior stakeholders, and users.

6. **Be present, collaborative, and consistent**

   Being available to the team to discuss the unexpected and share in the
   decision making is central to building empowered and protected teams.

   Product managers should regularly and actively communicate, review and defend
   our decisions - especially the unplanned or unexpected ones.

7. **Maintain a focus on outcomes**

   In the midst of delivery, key dates can loom large, and teams can be diverted
   onto things which seem urgent but aren‘t important.

   Product managers must help teams and stakeholders remain focused on outcomes
   over outputs, facilitating discussion and making space for reflection.

8. **Lead without authority**

   Product managers shouldn‘t be bottlenecks. Product managers and delivery
   leads work together to build skilled multidisciplinary teams and create the
   space in which those disciplines can do their best work.

   Product managers are open to new tools, techniques and approaches, working
   with teams to find what works.

9. **Take blame, give credit away**

   Good product managers leave their ego at the door, taking negative feedback
   on board whilst ensuring the team are rightly recognised for their work and
   achievements.

   Being kind is more important than being right - it‘s a good rule of thumb to
   enter every conversation without assuming that you already know most, or
   best.

10. **Strong opinions, softly held**

    Product managers make the best decisions based on the available information
    with confidence, staying open to the possibility that things could change
    when more information is available in the future.

    Product managers communicate the trade-offs they’re making and the rationale
    for their decisions so that teams can understand how a decision was reached,
    even when they don’t agree.

11. **Set clear priorities**

    Product managers work with the team, stakeholders and users to define
    priorities, and ensure these are clear.

12. **Measure outcomes**

    Product managers facilitate and work with service designers and business
    analysts to work out key metrics and goals for the product and work with the
    team to define roadmaps to achieve these goals.
