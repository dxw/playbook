At dxw, we believe that great teams need great leaders.

## Leadership principles

Whether or not they are in a formal management role, leaders at dxw are guided
by these principles.

1. **Set an example**

   Leaders at dxw demonstrate our values in everything we do. We set high
   standards of behaviour and inspire both colleagues and clients to do the
   same.

   We demonstrate fairness, integrity, and resilience, and build trust with our
   actions.

2. **Look after people**

   Leaders at dxw promote the wellbeing of individuals, teams and communities.
   We encourage a supportive culture and inclusive working arrangements. We
   prioritise 1:1 time with people to listen and understand their particular
   needs.

   We support and defend colleagues in difficult situations. We identify and
   deal with poor performance and bad behaviour.

3. **Take ownership**

   Leaders at dxw welcome responsibility and accountability. We’re proactive,
   pick up things that need doing without being asked and push to finish the job
   in hand.

   We’re the first to admit mistakes, apologise when wrong and learn for next
   time.

4. **Deliver for clients**

   Leaders at dxw understand how to deliver value for each client and create the
   conditions for dxw to do brilliant work. We are not afraid to challenge
   clients or ask difficult questions.

   We think commercially and push dxw to grow and strengthen as a business.

5. **Provide clarity**

   Leaders at dxw communicate clearly and concisely through the right channel.
   We question any decisions, goals or explanations that are vague or ambiguous
   and work to clarify them.

   We’re open, honest and straightforward in what we say and write. And we
   provide specific, understandable and useful feedback.

6. **Make good decisions**

   Leaders at dxw use evidence and judgement to make good decisions. We know
   that timely decisions are important, so we don’t procrastinate or fudge. We
   commit to collective decisions, particularly when we originally disagreed.

   We consult broadly, seek out contrary opinions, and listen to quieter voices.
   We make sure we can explain our decisions, with context, rationale and
   evidence.

7. **Point the way**

   Leaders at dxw share an inspiring vision for the future of dxw, and each
   individual’s part in it.

   On client and dxw projects, we make sure that colleagues understand the
   outcomes we want to achieve and the value that they will create.

8. **Build the future**

   Leaders at dxw hire great people. We actively look for the widest range of
   candidates to strengthen our diversity.

   We encourage our colleagues to learn, develop new skills, and pursue their
   career aspirations, whether at dxw or elsewhere. And we give people
   opportunity and responsibility at the right pace for them.

   We continually improve dxw capability, and the effectiveness and efficiency
   of our delivery. We try out new approaches and technologies and give others
   the time and space to do the same.
