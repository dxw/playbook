At dxw, we need to be sure that the computers on which we do our work are safe and secure. To do this, we have the concept of ‘trusted devices’. Sometimes you will see the phrase ‘bring your own device’ (BYOD), used to mean a trusted device that is your own.

These are computers that have a software configuration that we have decided that we can trust as secure enough for our needs. 

These needs are driven by the cyber security accreditations we need, best practices and our own specific requirements.

We require that devices meet one of the following criteria to satisfy our security and compliance obligations. These are defined in section 4 of our Device Policy - if in any doubt the definitions set in the Device Policy take precedence. As of January 2025, dxw may consider a device trusted if:

1. dxw issues a managed device with our endpoint management solutions.
2. a dxw client provides a managed device.
3. a dxw client is managing your device (BYOD) via their own endpoint management solutions and policies. 
4. dxw agrees to manage your device (BYOD), and you agree to all the terms and policies pertaining to this option.

## dxw bring you own device (BYOD) requirements

1. Your device must be an apple mac device that uses a supported version of the operating system(OS). For macOs this is typically one of the latest 3 releases of the OS. If while working for dxw your device’s macOS version drops out of support you will need to update or provide a different device to use for your dxw work.
2. At the end of the period of use as a dxw trusted device, you will be required to ‘wipe’ or ‘reset’ your device as instructed by our workplace tech team. 
3. 1. You will need to ‘[erase your mac and reset it to factory settings](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102664)’, and then confirm this with a statement to dxw (note the precise method may vary, but the effect will be the same).
   2. You could use Apple ‘[Time machine](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh14037/mac)’ to create a backup of your Mac before you setup your device with us. Then after erasing and resetting your device you can restore the Time Machine backup you made.
4. That you work with our workplace tech team to install our endpoint management solutions. This will give dxw full control over the device, its contents and install various applications that we use to manage our fleet. You will be required to commit to a short statement to the effect that you agree to dxw securing your device. 
5. You will also need to agree that dxw has the right to forbid you from taking the device back under your own control. dxw requires this right so it can be evoked in the case of an investigation, legal reason, security risks or similar. If this occurs, it will be clearly communicated to you what you need to do, and you will be given an estimate for the duration of the event. Control will normally be returned to you upon contract termination. 
6. The device will not be covered by any dxw insurance, we suggest that you consider your own insurance against loss theft and/or damage.

dxw will then record that you have a trusted personal device.
