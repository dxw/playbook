*This guide is for the person responsible for investigating and writing up the
incident. This will not necessarily be the incident lead who responded to the
incident.*

Most incidents get a report,
[based on this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J9bz-B8AxM7fWl7GFxSj7y287f_mmiLRWBHsubQ2wsA/edit),
with:

* An overview of the incident, including impact figures

  * requests/visits/users impacted and over what time
* A timeline of events and response actions
* An explanation of the incident, including contributing factors
* Any proposed actions

This is primarily an internal document, but a condensed version will be made
available to the client. You should store it in a new folder in the
[incidents folder on Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BkebF1TtHSrP863K8Y2uScDa0VSETdYj?usp=sharing)
along with all files relating to the incident.

### First draft

You should prepare a draft report immediately after the incident, and should
focus on the objective data like Slack transcripts, screenshots, and logs.
Subjective data like opinions, judgments, assumptions, and beliefs will come up
in the review meeting. You should avoid using names to avoid appearing to blame
people.

You should circulate the draft to those involved in the incident in advance of
the incident review meeting, and any minor amendments should be done as
comments/suggestions in the doc. Anything that requires discussion should wait
until the incident review. Getting comments in advance helps us make the best
use of the meeting time.

‘Draft’ in this case means that all sections should be completed in at least
outline form, but there may be some outstanding questions that need answering
and some additional detail that is needed. Part of the purpose of the incident
review is to fill in these gaps.

### Final version

You should produce a final version of the report with more detail following the
review meeting (see below).

An abridged version with a link to the full report should be published
internally on Bikeshed, and copy should be shared with the affected clients
(usually through a Zendesk ticket). You should check the client version by a director
for anything that might make us commercially liable, but as a rule we should be
as open as possible.
