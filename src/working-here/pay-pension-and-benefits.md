All perks and benefits are available to the dxw team after the successful
passing of their probationary period.

## Changes to your details

Please tell us promptly if your name, address, telephone number, next of kin
details or banking details change and keep those details up to date in Breathe.

## Pay Policy

### Purpose

The purpose of the dxw pay policy is to give us a framework to pay salaries at
the highest level we can, in the fairest way possible and in the most
sustainable way for the long-term commercial health of the business. Alongside
our mission and values, and the way we look after and develop our teams, it’s an
important part of us being able to attract and retain great people.

### Principles

The following principles underpin the policy:

- Transparency
- Parity amongst similar roles
- Equality of pay for those with the same role
- Clear levels of responsibility and accountability
- Clear career progression

### How the policy works

1. Applies to all staff in both billable and non billable teams. Statutory
   directors will each have a performance framework that is independent from
   this policy.
2. Billable team pay has published pay points per level, that are based on 3
   main factors:

   - [Skills for the Information Age (SFIA)](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-12/documents/92768/886204607156866-sfia-rate-card-2020-07-17-1338.pdf)
     standards and rates which clients use to measure dxw against
   - profitability margins based on expected billable rates
   - the labour market and salaries based on this

3. Non billable team pay has published pay bands that are based fundamentally on
   the labour market, but could also include other factors such as professional
   qualifications and sales targets.
4. Each director is responsible for overseeing pay for their teams and has
   overall responsibility for justifying decisions against the principles and
   criteria in this policy. This policy will be reviewed at least every 2 years.
   The review will take place between October and February, to avoid changes to
   salaries shortly before the annual CPI rise. Any changes to pay points /
   bands will be subject to approval by the dxw board.
5. For roles equivalent to
   [SFIA levels 1-5](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-12/documents/92768/886204607156866-sfia-rate-card-2020-07-17-1338.pdf)
   we would expect promotions or pay changes to be handled within the team based
   on the progression framework, with a director or delegated head of taking
   responsibility for this
6. For roles that are more senior i.e.
   [SFIA level 6](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-12/documents/92768/886204607156866-sfia-rate-card-2020-07-17-1338.pdf)
   equivalent or above we would expect the board to consider these, with
   internal interview panels to help make a decision (where necessary)
7. Everyone should have an annual review of their performance and career
   progression and pay as a minimum after passing probation. It's up to each
   line manager to arrange more frequent check-ins on progression, so that the
   outcome of the annual review is not a surprise
8. Line managers are responsible for ensuring that all staff are given equal
   opportunities, and pay discussions are fair and inclusive. If staff would
   like an independent opinion in these discussions, they should contact the HR team
   in the first instance who can facilitate.
9. dxw works with an independent HR advisor, who can assist if needed to help
   resolve any issues.

### Cost of living

10. London weighting of £4,000 per year applies to staff who earn under £40,000
    per year to help them with the additional costs of living in London.

    - This applies to people who live in a London borough.
    - If someone’s salary increases above this level, London weighting will
      gradually taper off (by £500 for each £1000 of extra salary) between
      £40,000 and £48,000
    - The rationale for these numbers is taken from Trust for London research
      which shows London weighting materially benefits people on salaries under
      £40,000.
    - It is subject to tax & NI and is not pensionable
    - It is a fixed rate, not uplifted by CPI

11. Annual cost of living CPI rises will apply for staff if the company achieves
    turnover above its minimum target for the preceding financial year.

    - If you’ve passed your probation then you’ll receive your raise in October
      payroll
    - CPI rises will not apply to people who for historic reasons are above the
      maximum pay level for their role, to help us gradually align salaries for
      similar roles
    - If someone is under formal disciplinary or performance procedures, their
      CPI rise will be postponed while this is ongoing
    - The CPI figure comes from published Office of National Statistics data

12. We are committed to paying the London living wage or higher for all staff.

## Cost of living raise

dxw will institute a cost of living raise each year on 1st October. The
percentage will be set by the
[CPI Index](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices) as of 1st
October each year.

- Annual cost of living CPI rises will apply for staff if the company achieves
  turnover above its minimum target for the preceding financial year.
- If you have passed your probation, you will receive your raise in the October
  payroll.
- For those team members who joined prior to 1st October of that year, but
  haven't yet passed probation, you will receive your raise in the month you
  successfully complete it and it will be the same percentage as of 1st October
  CPI that year.
- If you joined on or after 1st October (that year), you will not be eligible
  for a cost of living raise until the following October.
- If you are leaving during October you will not receive the cost of living
  raise.

## Pensions

dxw provides a pension which is operated by Aviva. Once you have passed your 3
month check in, you will be auto enrolled into the scheme, receive details by
post of the necessary employer/employee contributions and have the option to set
your percentage or opt out.

dxw will match any contribution up to 5%.

Your contribution will be relief at source, with 0.8 deducted from your monthly
salary and the additional 0.2 added from tax relief.

For more details on Relief at Source, please visit the
[Aviva website](https://www.aviva.co.uk/retirement/news-views/report/making-sense-of-tax-relief-on-pension-payments/).

## Holiday

W﻿e offer 25 days of annual leave plus bank holidays each   calendar year. If you are working part-time or on a fixed-term contract with us, the amount of holiday you are entitled to will be pro-rated. 

The holiday year at dxw runs between 1st January and 31st December, and you are able to carry over up 5 days of unused leave to the following year, if desired. 

### B﻿ooking holiday

1. Discuss the dates with your team and delivery lead

   This gives them a chance to manage any impact it might have on the wider team
   and the project.

2. Request the holiday through BreatheHR

   We use BreatheHR to track who's off and when, so we can plan for it. Your
   line manager can then see and approve your request.

3. Add your holiday to your Google calendar

   If someone is trying to find out where you are, or when you're available, the
   first thing they'll check is your calendar.

   When you are on a client project, you may also need to add your holiday to a
   shared or team calendar. Check with your delivery lead.

Your line manager will normally approve requests that are for 10 days or less
and made at least 4 weeks in advance. Anything longer or requested with less
notice will need to be managed to understand its impact on client, team or
personal work.

When your planned leave has been approved, it will be automatically added to
Productive. Each member of our delivery team uses the tool to record the days
they work on client projects on a weekly basis.

There is more information about dxw's holiday arrangements in your contract of
employment.

## TOIL (Time off in lieu)

Where possible we try to keep a sustainable pace of work and avoid working
outside normal hours; occasionally this might not be possible.

### How is TOIL calculated?

TOIL (time off in lieu) is awarded when you work over and above your contracted
working hours continuously for a period of time or when you attend/travel to an
event outside of your contracted working hours. TOIL should be agreed with your
delivery lead or line manager ahead of doing the extra work.

We encourage you to use your TOIL within the two weeks of extra work or event
attended as it's meant to be for resting and making up for working at a
sustainable pace. We know this may not be feasible in every case so please speak
to your Line Manager or a member of the HR team if you have any questions.

There are two options of how to use your TOIL, you can calculate the amount of
hours you have accrued (i.e. half a day) and take it off at once or take a couple
of hours a day spread over a period of time. Planning when you’ll take TOIL is
important, particularly if you’re working on a billable project so please speak
to your Delivery Lead before doing any overtime and arrange when you’ll be able
to take the time back.

### How to request TOIL?

Using BreatheHR similar to the way that you request holiday, there is a TOIL
drop down, please write a note as to why you are requesting the leave and this
will be approved by a member of the HR team. Please note this will not deduct
from your holiday allowance shown on your BreatheHR dashboard.

## Sickness

This policy covers both short and longer term sickness absences. Our aim is to
look after the health and wellbeing of all dxw staff and the needs of the
company.

### Communication of sickness

If you’re sick, you must let your line manager and a member of the HR team know
by 10:00am or as soon as you reasonably can after that. This can be done via
email, directly on Slack, phone call or text. Line managers will record and
monitor sickness for individuals within their teams.

If you are unwell and know that you are going to be off for a period of time, or
have been signed off by your GP until a certain date, you don’t need to update
your line manager daily. Let them know when you will be checking in again so
they know when to expect to hear from you.

When you return to work, you must check your sickness has been correctly
recorded in BreatheHR, update it if necessary and mark yourself as returned to
work. Your line manager will then review and close the sick leave. If you're
sick for more than 28 calendar days in a row, you'll also need to provide a
doctor's note.

### Absence meetings

Your line manager should check-in with you on a regular basis about your
wellbeing, and catch up with you after any sickness absence to see how you are.
If you're sick for more than 7 working days over a rolling 12 month period, your
line manager will invite you to an absence meeting to discuss your health. Where
appropriate, we’ll talk about how we can support your return to work and any
temporary or permanent adjustments which might help improve your wellbeing and
support you to need fewer absences. We might also agree an action plan and / or
a review period. Where we think it would be helpful, we’ll seek advice via an
Occupational Health advisor.

If you have a long term health condition and would like to discuss reasonable
adjustments and ways of working that will help, we welcome a conversation at any
point. The sooner we know, the sooner we can support you.

### Reasonable Adjustments

A reasonable adjustment is “a change to remove or reduce the effect of an
employees’ disability or long term health condition so they can do their job”.
If you would like to discuss ways of working and reasonable adjustments that
will help you, please talk to your line manager or the people manager at any
point. The sooner we know, the sooner we can support you. We will never use the
disclosure of a disability or long term health condition against you.

We’ll organise a meeting (or a series of meetings if needed) between you, your
line manager, and the people manager where we will discuss any difficulties you
are facing and how dxw are able to support you. If there is any additional
support we can reasonably give you, for example changes to your working pattern
or working environment, we will. We need to balance dxw’s financial
sustainability and the unavoidable impact of any adjustments made on your teams
with your needs to make sure we are able to give fair and consistent treatment
to everyone in need of adjustments, but we will make every effort to make
working at dxw as healthy and sustainable for you as we can.

If you need further support, in addition to any support we are able to provide
you as an employer and through occupational health, there may be state provided
benefits that apply to you. These may include
[disability and sickness benefits](https://www.gov.uk/financial-help-disabled/disability-and-sickness-benefits)
or the [Access to Work scheme](https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work). If you would
like support finding, understanding, or applying for alternatives outside of dxw
please discuss this with your line manager or our people manager.

### Pay

Within any rolling 12 month period, a person will receive:

- full pay for the first 12 days of sickness absence
- half pay (but no less than living wage) for the next 8 days of sickness
  absence
- real living wage for the next 10 days of sickness absence
- statutory sick pay pay after 30 days of sickness absence

There'll be circumstances where we'll make exceptions, because it's not possible
to write a policy that is fair in every situation. This structure will form our
starting point for those decisions. All decisions on exceptions will be made by
the Directors’ group. Our aim is to ensure that we’re treating everyone fairly
and consistently, while being aware of our financial requirements.

### Long term medical treatment

Regular and open communication with your line manager is important so we can
support you in the best possible way through a period of long term medical
treatment (a period of more than 2 weeks).

If you require long term medical treatment that would affect your ability to
work as normal, but you are still able to work, we will support this wherever we
can. We may consider a change of project or role where that’s an option.

If you finish your treatment, your line manager will organise a meeting to aid
your return to work, or to normal working hours, and ensure your ongoing
wellbeing is supported. We may look at a phased return for example.

### Escalation

If your sickness absence continues for 3 months after an absence meeting, your
line manager will set up a further meeting to discuss your situation. We will
look to make any further reasonable adjustments to help you get back working.
This might include looking for a suitable alternative role that fits your
circumstances better.

Where we’re unable to reach an agreement that means you’re able to maintain a
reasonable level of attendance for work, we may consider your dismissal. We will
only do this after we have exhausted all other options.

### Medical appointments

We support staff who need regular time off for medical appointments or
counselling. If you need to attend an appointment, you should talk to your line
manager. For meetings of a couple of hours or so (including travel time), your
line manager will usually ask you to try to make the hours up during the week.
If the time off is longer but less frequent, the hours can be made up over a
longer period of time.

If you need to attend a one off appointment or an appointment for a dependent
let your line manager or delivery lead know as far in advance as possible. If
you are going to be away from work for more than half a day then you will need
to track it through BreatheHR.

In both cases, this might mean a conversation with your delivery lead or
equivalent to make sure work is managed in the best way. If it’s not possible to
recover the time taken in a flexible way, for example, due to the amount or
pattern of time needed, your line manager may need to refer to another one of
our policies. That might include considering a part-time working pattern.

## Compassionate leave

If you need to take compassionate leave, let your line manager and a member of
the HR team know, so we can support you in the right way. If you are on a
project, we can then work with your delivery lead to manage the impact on the
team.

Compassionate leave is likely to affect many of us at some time or other, in
many different ways. Typically compassionate leave covers things like
bereavement or the sudden illness of close relatives and friends. But we
understand that loss can manifest itself in other forms which can affect your
wellbeing.

This policy aims to set some guidance for line managers while also allowing
reasonable flexibility to reflect different circumstances.

In the first instance, line managers can allow up to 3 days of paid
compassionate leave. They should consult their Director for approval if they
think further paid leave may be appropriate in the circumstances.

Our automatic parental bereavement entitlement is 2 weeks of paid leave, as set
out by
[ACAS](https://www.acas.org.uk/time-off-for-bereavement/parental-bereavement-leave-pay).

There is the option for additional time off to be taken using annual or unpaid
leave. This should be agreed between the line manager and Director, in
consultation with HR. We can also provide support for people returning to work
in line with our existing policies.

To record compassionate leave in BreatheHR, choose Other as the Type of Leave,
and choose Compassionate as the Reason.

## Jury duty leave

Jury duty leave is generally paid for each day (or part thereof) that you are
required to attend Court -

- if you are required to complete Jury Service dxw will pay your normal salary
  less £64.95 per day. Once you have completed your Jury Service you are able to
  claim £64.95 towards your loss of earnings, and any care or childcare outside
  of your usual arrangements
  [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/687809/certificate-of-loss-eng.pdf)
- dxw will re-consider the payment amount if an individual is on a case that
  exceeds 4 weeks. This amount will be reviewed by Directors and a decision will
  be made with the individual

Let your line manager or HR manager know as soon as you are able that you have
been requested for Jury Service with a copy of your jury summons

## Parental leave

We’re aware that there is a lot to take in here - please come and talk to the HR
People Manager if you have questions about anything (when you’re ready).

While many terms around parental leave are gendered, gender is not a factor in
what leave you are entitled to from dxw. What matters is whether you, or your
partner if you have one, are pregnant, adopting or having a baby through
surrogacy.

We also make a distinction based on whether you are a primary carer (the person
who will be on parental leave for the longer period of time) or a secondary
carer (the person who will be returning to work first) as there will be
differences in both the statutory and dxw entitlement.

This policy will be reviewed in May 2022.

### Understanding your entitlement

We’ve detailed the different entitlements that dxw offer in addition to your
statutory entitlement below. There’s an
[online calculator](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-paternity-pay-leave) for
working out your statutory entitlement. If you’d like support working out your
anticipated pay and you’re ready to share the news even just with a select few,
you can speak to the HR People Manager for a personal breakdown of your
entitlement.

### If you’re having IVF or another fertility treatment

If you share with us that you are undergoing fertility treatment you will be
supported in the same way as for other longer term medical treatment. Regular,
open and confidential communication with your line manager will be important, so
we can support you in the best possible way.

### If you’re pregnant

Summary: In most cases, you will be paid 100% of your normal salary for the
first 18 weeks of leave, reduced to the government statutory rate per week for
the following 21 weeks.

#### What you are legally entitled to:

If you’re pregnant, you’ll be entitled to Statutory Maternity Leave (SML) and
probably entitled to Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP). Statutory Maternity Leave
entitles you to 52 weeks leave, made up of Ordinary Maternity Leave for the
first 26 weeks and Additional Maternity Leave for the last 26 weeks.

Statutory Maternity Pay is paid by the government for up to 39 weeks. They will
pay you 90% of your normal salary for the first 6 weeks of your leave. You must
have worked for dxw for 26 weeks before your
[qualifying week](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/20771/qualifying-week.jpg)
(the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth) to be eligible for SMP or
you will be entitled to
[Maternity Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-allowance) instead.

#### What dxw offers in addition:

If you are the primary carer, dxw will pay you 100% of your salary for the next
12 weeks of your leave and will top up your first 6 weeks of SMP (if you are
entitled to it) to 100%. This contribution is called Occupational Maternity Pay
(OMP) . Taken together, this means that you would have 18 weeks of leave on 100%
of your normal salary.

As with all company benefits, you will be entitled to Occupational Maternity Pay
once you are no longer on your probationary period. For the Statutory Maternity
Pay eligibility criteria, please refer to
[government eligibility information for maternity pay](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/eligibility).

After the 18 weeks, your pay will then reduce to the
[government statutory rate for maternity pay](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/pay)
per week for the following 21 weeks.

A person giving birth must take at least the first 2 weeks after the birth as
parental leave.

When you know you are pregnant please tell us as soon as you are comfortable. We
can restrict this knowledge to your Director, Line Manager and People Manager
and it will allow us to check that your working arrangements are safe, help you
manage any pregnancy related sickness and make sure you are paid for time off
for
[antenatal care appointments](https://www.gov.uk/working-when-pregnant-your-rights).
Legally you don’t have to make us aware until 15 weeks before your due date. We
will require a MATB1 certificate ahead of your parental leave, the earlier we
receive this, the earlier we can help with calculations.

Please refer here for further statutory terms around
[pregnancy](https://www.gov.uk/employers-maternity-pay-leave).

### If you’re adopting

Summary: In most cases, you will be paid 100% of your normal salary for the
first 18 weeks of leave, reduced to the government statutory rate per week for
the following 21 weeks.

#### What you are legally entitled to:

If you are adopting, you’ll probably be eligible for Statutory Adoption Leave
and Statutory Adoption Pay. Statutory Adoption Leave entitles you to 52 weeks of
leave, made up of 26 weeks of Ordinary Adoption Leave and 26 weeks of Additional
Adoption Leave.

Statutory Adoption Pay is paid by the government for up to 39 weeks. The
government will pay you 90% of your normal salary for the first 6 weeks of your
leave. You must have worked for dxw for at least 26 weeks by the week you were
matched with a child and give at least 28 days notice of the adoption leave.
[Proof of adoption](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/how-to-claim) is
required to qualify for Statutory Adoption Pay.

#### What dxw offers in addition:

If you are the primary carer, dxw will pay you 100% of your salary for the next
12 weeks of your leave and top up the first 6 weeks of Statutory Adoption Pay
(if you are entitled to it) to 100%. Taken together, this means that you would
have 18 weeks of leave on 100% of your normal salary.

As with all company benefits, you will be entitled to Occupational Adoption Pay
once you are no longer on your probationary period. For the Statutory Adoption
Pay eligibility criteria, please refer to
[government eligibility information for adoption pay](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/eligibility).

Your pay will then reduce to the
[government statutory rate for adoption pay](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/pay)
per week for the following 21 weeks.

Only 1 person in a couple can take
[statutory adoption leave](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/leave). The
other partner could get secondary carer leave/pay instead (see secondary carer
section below).

If you are taking adoption leave, you are entitled to paid time off work to
attend 5 adoption appointments after you’ve been matched with a child.

### If you’re having baby through surrogacy

Summary: In most cases, you will be paid 100% of your normal salary for the
first 18 weeks of leave, reduced to the government statutory rate per week for
the following 21 weeks.

#### What you are legally entitled to:

If you are having a baby through surrogacy, you’ll probably be eligible for
Statutory Adoption Leave and Statutory Adoption Pay. Assuming you are entitled
to Statutory Adoption Leave, this entitles you to 52 weeks of leave, made up of
26 weeks of Ordinary Adoption Leave and 26 weeks of Additional Adoption Leave.

Statutory Adoption Pay is paid for up to 39 weeks. The government will pay you
90% of your normal salary for the first six 6 weeks of your leave. You must have
worked for dxw for at least 26 weeks by the week and advise us by way of a
[statutory declaration](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/how-to-claim) at
least 15 weeks before the expected week of birth.

#### What dxw offers in addition:

If you are the primary carer, dxw will pay you 100% of your salary for the next
12 weeks of your leave and top up the first 6 weeks of Statutory Adoption Pay
(if you are entitled to it) to 100%. Taken together, this means that you would
have 18 weeks of leave on 100% of your normal salary.

As with all company benefits, you will be entitled to Occupational Adoption Pay
once you are no longer on your probationary period. For the Statutory Adoption
Pay eligibility criteria, please refer to
[government eligibility information for adoption pay](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/eligibility).

Your pay will then reduce to the
[government statutory rate for adoption pay](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/pay)
per week for the following 21 weeks.

Only 1 person in a couple can take adoption leave. The other partner could get
secondary carer leave/pay instead (see secondary carer section below).

### If you are the secondary carer

As a reminder, the primary carer is the person who will be on parental leave for
the longer period of time. The secondary carer is the person who will be
returning to work first.

The main statutory entitlement for secondary carers is still known as paternity
leave, and that is the only reason we use the term in this context.

Summary: In most cases, you will be paid 100% of your normal salary for 5 weeks.

#### What you are legally entitled to:

If your partner is pregnant, you are adopting, or you are having a baby through
surrogacy, you’ll probably be eligible for Statutory Paternity Leave (SPL) and
Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) or Statutory Adoption Leave and Statutory Adoption
Pay.

SPL may be taken for one or two consecutive weeks, between the date of birth and
56 days afterwards. You can find the
[current SPP rate here](https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave/pay).

#### What dxw offers in addition:

dxw will instead pay you 100% of your normal salary for 5 weeks of parental
leave. You may take these consecutively or separately during the first year from
birth/adoption. If you want to take more than 5 weeks of leave you can use
shared parental leave (see below).

If you are going to become the primary carer for any reason (for example medical
incapacity, or bereavement) within the first 18 weeks from the birth or adoption
of a child, dxw will consider your eligibility for 100% pay in line with our
offer for primary carers. Please approach the People Manager to discuss this.

As with all company benefits, you will be entitled to these once you are no
longer on your probationary period.

### Shared parental leave

If you’re having a baby, adopting a child, or having a baby through surrogacy,
you may be eligible for Shared Parental Leave and Pay. There are a lot of
factors to eligibility, please refer to the
[government site](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) to review
your particular circumstances.

If you’re eligible and you or your partner ends maternity or adoption leave and
pay (or Maternity Allowance) early, then you can:

- take the rest of the 50 weeks of maternity or adoption leave as Shared
  Parental Leave (SPL)
- take the rest of the 37 weeks of maternity or adoption pay (or Maternity
  Allowance) as Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP). ShPP is paid at the
  [current rate per week](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/what-youll-get)
  or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.

If you’re interested in taking this up, please talk to the People Manager. As
with all company benefits, you will be entitled to these once you are no longer
on your probationary period.

### Keeping in touch (KIT) days

For pregnancy, adoption and surrogacy, the primary carer has 10 paid KIT days to
take during their parental leave, if they wish to come in for departmental
meetings, events or just to spend some time with the team.

Those on shared parental leave can each work up to 20 days while taking SPL.
These are called
[‘Shared Parental Leave in touch’](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/booking-blocks-of-leave#:~:text=Shared%20Parental%20Leave%20in%20touch,on%20maternity%20or%20adoption%20leave.)
(or SPLIT) days. These days are in addition to the 10 ‘keeping in touch’ (or
KIT) days available to the primary carer.

This won't affect your statutory pay and dxw will top this up so you receive a
normal day's pay for each KIT/SPLIT day.

### Returning to work

Returning to work is a personal decision - the earliest you can return to work
legally after giving birth is 2 weeks, and you can take up to 52 weeks of
parental leave in total. Speak with your line manager when you have an idea of
how long you would like to take. You are free to change your mind while on
parental leave, as long as 8 weeks notice is given for an intended change to
your return date.

You may wish to consider a phased return when you do come back and this can also
be discussed with your line manager. If for some reason you decide not to return
to work, we do not expect you to pay back any of your parental leave.

### Holiday accrual

All carers will continue to accrue holiday while they are on parental leave and
any bank holidays that they miss will be added to their holiday entitlement when
they return to work. They can choose to use this annual leave before or after
their parental leave, or have some paid out during their parental leave.

## Childcare Vouchers

The Government closed the Childcare Vouchers scheme to new entrants on 4th
October 2018. This means we are no longer able to add new members to the voucher
scheme with Busy Bees.

The government has introduced new ways to help parents with childcare costs
which you access directly: <https://www.gov.uk/get-tax-free-childcare>

For more information, please speak to the People Manager.

## Flexible working

We aim to offer flexibility for people looking for a part-time role or a role
with flexible hours. Our policy is informed by the way we work and the way we
charge clients for our time.

If you have an alternative working arrangement, you should make sure it’s
reflected in your calendar so the rest of the team can be confident in knowing
when you are and aren’t around.

### Requesting a change of working arrangement

If you would like to discuss a change to your working pattern, first speak to
your line manager. They will discuss your request, and look at the impact on the
team and your work.

Any changes to working patterns are agreed at our discretion and your line
manager should review them with you from time to time, to check they are still
working for you and dxw.

Once you would like to progress with a new flexible working pattern, please fill
in the
[change of working pattern request form](https://forms.gle/qA1BwvQenqtVzShF8)
and the HR team will make the necessary changes.

### Normal working pattern

The normal working pattern is 5 days per week, Monday to Friday, and 7 hours per
day (excluding a break for lunch).

### Part time working

#### Weekly or fortnightly working patterns

We’re happy to talk about a 3 or 4 day week, a 9 day fortnight, or a shorter
working day, where it makes sense for your role. This will depend on the nature
of your role, client, and dxw needs, and the impact on other team members.

Part time roles have their salary and holiday allowances (including bank
holidays) prorated.

For example, when working a 4 day week, the pro rata leave allowance will be 20
days per year of annual leave and 6.5 bank holiday days, giving a total leave
allowance of 26.5 days.

Note that you must book bank holidays that don’t fall on a non-working day as
annual leave in BreatheHR when following this working pattern.

#### Working patterns over longer periods

As an alternative to a working pattern that reduces your days or hours in a
week, we’re happy to talk about working patterns that involve a regular number
of weeks working full-time, followed by some full weeks off.

For example, you might work 4 weeks full-time and have your fifth week off, and
repeat that on a 5 week cycle: 4 weeks on, 1 week off, 4 weeks on, 1 week off,
etc. Alternatively, you might work during school term times, and take the school
holidays off.

This pattern works by reducing your salary and borrowing from the pro rata
holiday and bank holiday allowance, increasing your total time off but reducing
your freely placed holiday allowance. Your annual free holiday allowance might
vary year by year depending on how the weeks and bank holidays land in the year,
so the pattern must have enough free holiday to cover the maximum number of days
you would need off while still allowing you to take some ad hoc holidays
throughout the year.

As a rough guide on how different patterns would impact your salary:

- 7 weeks on, 1 week off: 90-95% FTE salary
- 6 weeks on, 1 week off: 85-90% FTE salary
- 5 weeks on, 1 week off: 85-90% FTE salary
- 4 weeks on, 1 week off: 80-85% FTE salary
- school term on, school holidays off: 70% FTE salary

We are happy to discuss the details and work out the best pattern for you.

### Compressed hours

Working with compressed hours involves working your full hours in fewer days.
For example, 35 hours in 4 days, from 09:30 to 18:45.

We are happy to discuss compressed hours for all roles but cannot guarantee this
will always be an option. Arrangements must be
[sustainable](/who-we-are/#work-at-a-sustainable-pace) for your wellbeing and
productivity and the needs of the role.

For working patterns with an equal number of hours every day, holiday allowance
will be prorated in the same way as for
[part-time roles](#weekly-or-fortnightly-working-patterns). Working patterns
with varied daily hours have annual leave prorated and calculated in hours (231
hours per year). You must book bank holidays that fall on working days as leave
in BreatheHR.

### Returners’ programme

We offer a
[returners’ programme](/working-here/what-to-expect-when-joining-dxw/#returners-programme)
for people who are returning to work after a prolonged break. As part of this,
we’re able to offer a phased return to work. If this interests you, please talk
to us when applying.

### Remote working/location

We are able to work successfully in a remote capacity, from our homes. On
occasions, it may be necessary to work from one of our office spaces, a client
location or another location approved by dxw in order to complete a specific
task. It is important that you remain contactable and productive.

### Changing your working arrangement

If you would like to discuss a change to the standard working pattern, you can
either speak to your line manager or the HR Manager. In this initial
conversation, we will discuss your request, look at the impact on the team and
your work, agree the best time for this arrangement to begin and how it will be
communicated to those necessary.

If you have an alternative working arrangement, you should make sure it’s
reflected in your calendar so the rest of the team can be confident in knowing
when you are and aren’t around.

## Grievances

If you have a grievance about your employment or a complaint about another
member of staff, talk to the Managing Director as soon as possible.

The first step is to discuss the problem to see if it can be quickly resolved.

If this discussion does not satisfactorily resolve the problem, you should put
details of your grievance in writing and send it to the Managing Director. They
will arrange a meeting to discuss the matter, at which you may be accompanied by
a colleague or trade union official. Following this discussion the Managing
Director will provide a written response.

If you disagree with this response or the matter remains unresolved, you may
appeal by responding in writing. A further meeting will be arranged and the
Managing Director will again respond in writing. This decision will be final.

## Disciplinary procedure

If you do something that we feel constitutes misconduct, or your performance in
your job has been poor, we'll talk to you about it. Hopefully, there's just been
some misunderstanding, or some problem that's easy to solve and won't recur.
Formal action will not be taken without careful investigation of the facts.

If we feel it's appropriate, we may verbally warn you, explaining what has been
unacceptable and what you need to do to improve your conduct or performance.

If your conduct or performance fails to improve following a verbal warning, or
if the matter is serious enough that a verbal warning is not appropriate, we may
hold a disciplinary meeting at which you may be accompanied or represented by a
colleague or trade union official. Following this meeting, we may:

- Conclude that no misconduct has taken place, or that there is no poor
  performance
- Issue you with a written warning, which will explain:

  - The nature of the misconduct or poor performance
  - The change to your behaviour or performance that you need to make
  - The time within which the change needs to be made
  - The consequences of not making the change (for example, dismissal)

- In cases of gross misconduct, dismiss you without notice

If you disagree with the outcome of this hearing, you may appeal against the
decision. You must do this in writing. If you do so, your appeal and the
circumstances of your case will be reviewed by a member of staff who has not
been involved in your case before. That member of staff and the Managing
Director will then meet to discuss your case, and will either uphold the outcome
or schedule another disciplinary meeting. dxw's decision following that meeting
will be final.
