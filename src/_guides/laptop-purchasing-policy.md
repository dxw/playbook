title: Laptop Purchasing Policy
---
This policy has been created to assist employees who are buying dxw-owned
laptops. Please note there is no obligation to buy your laptop upon leaving dxw
or getting a laptop refresh.

## Who is eligible?

dxw is able to make employee-assigned laptops available to buy if you are
leaving us or if you are eligible for a refresh. For a machine to be eligible to
buy it must meet the following criteria:

* The machine must be more than two years old, or being refreshed
* You must have successfully completed your probationary period
* You must sign a waiver to confirm you accept the machine in its current
  condition

## What is the process for buying laptops?

If you are interested in buying your machine, a member of the commercial
operations team will be able to confirm the purchase dates for you and whether
you are eligible to buy. Please give at least two weeks' notice of your intent
to buy. Please note: your machine will still need to be wiped (by you, while on
a call with a member of the technical operations team) ahead of the purchase
which will erase all data from the machine. It is your responsibility to back up
any personal data that you need to keep to another location prior to the machine
being wiped.

## How is the purchase price calculated?

We calculate the price of your laptop in the following way:

* A member of the tech-ops team will factor in the age, specification, and
  condition of your machine and compare it with the equivalent selling price on
  an online site
* The price of the previous 5 machines sold on an online site will be considered
  and the mean price will be calculated
* A 20% employee discount is then applied

## Warranty and terms of purchase

If you decide to buy your laptop, please sign the
[Laptop Purchasing Waiver](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ey5Hex20n9DuQrQeebG6CdgPqrKW1LpFTeG9U9cl0Eo/edit#)
to say that you agree to accept your laptop in its current condition. Once you
assume ownership, any warranties or insurance dxw may hold for the laptop will
expire. dxw will not be responsible for any faults or damage that either exist
or go on to develop after you buy the laptop.

# Who do I speak to for more information?

specific query, please speak to a member of the commercial operations team who
