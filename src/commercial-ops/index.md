We are the team that enables and encourages dxw to achieve its mission(s) and
uphold its values.

## Commercial operations team principles

### Things we do

1. We deliver the dxw business plan. In particular, we recruit the best people
   to meet our mission, manage our finances to allow sustainable growth, and
   track performance of objectives to measure ourselves.
2. We are the front door for staff and clients. We help, support and enable dxw
   to meet its mission and uphold its values. We do this by being empathetic and
   put people over process.
3. As commercial experts we take the burden away from our delivery teams, and
   make sure our people, as well as our suppliers get paid, whilst also ensuring
   our clients pay us on time.
4. The unit of delivery is always the team, so we ensure staff wellbeing by
   providing a safe and inclusive environment. We also support our people to
   thrive in all stages of their careers, ensuring they have chance to
   continually learn, as well as excellent facilities and the right tools to
   enable them to succeed in their careers.
5. We ensure dxw is compliant with all the relevant company and employment
   regulations, ensuring we have ISO 27001 accreditation, abide by GDPR
   guidelines and insurance.
6. Commercial and business operations can be thankless, but to manage
   expectations we remain resilient and take responsibility for our work by
   effectively communicating about what we do and why we do it.
