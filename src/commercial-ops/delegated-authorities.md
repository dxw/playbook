Each year, the Trustees and the Company Board agree a set of targets (and a
floor) for turnover and profitability, based on the financial modelling of the
business plan. The Company Board are then responsible for delivering on that
plan with support from the Operational Leadership Team, and report to the
Trustees on progress each quarter.

The sections below describe how the financial aspects of the plan are managed.

1. **Salary costs**

   The Company Board agrees dxw’s Reward Philosophy (pay policy). Should there
   be any need for an exception to the policy, this must be agreed by the
   Company Board.

   Each client-facing director is responsible for delivering the target gross
   margin produced by their teams. They can hire (or if necessary, reduce
   headcount) for their area. Any proposal to reduce headcount by redundancy
   (rather than natural attrition) must be agreed by the Company Board.

   Each central-services director has provision made in the plan for their
   staffing costs. They can hire up to the level of that provision, as long as
   financial performance is on track. Any proposal to increase headcount beyond
   that cost envelope must be agreed by the Company Board. Should financial
   performance mean that central costs need to be reduced, any plan to reduce
   headcount by redundancy must be agreed by the Company Board.

2. **Other staff costs**

   The Finance and Resources Director has lead responsibility for managing
   these costs. They can spend up to the provision made in the plan, subject to
   gross profit being on track. If gross profit is not on track, they must look
   to constrain these costs, such that the net profit ‘floor’ is achieved.

   The day to day management of these costs is achieved via various policies
   (travel, learning & development etc) set by the Finance and Resources
   Director and agreed by the Company Board.

3. **Premises costs and professional fees**

   The Finance and Resources Director has lead responsibility for managing these costs.
   They can spend up to the provision made in the plan, subject to gross profit
   being on track. If gross profit is not on track, they must look to constrain
   these costs, such that the net profit 'floor' is achieved.

4. **Marketing costs**

   The Director of Communications has lead responsibility for managing these
   costs. They can spend up to the provision made in the plan, subject to gross
   profit being on track. If gross profit is not on track, it's possible that
   additional expenditure may be needed, if there's a reasonable expectation
   that it generates more turnover. This must be agreed at the Company Board.

5. **Financing costs and taking on debt**

   The Company Board will agree financing strategy for any new material capital
   projects or acquisitions, with the Trustees.

   The Finance and Resources Director has lead responsibility for assessing
   these commitments and the overall liquidity of the business. This includes
   quantifying the level of fixed/floating rate risk taken on.

6. **Project resourcing decisions**

   The way we resource our project teams has a significant impact on our gross
   profit margin. Using dxw payroll staff will usually be our preferred route,
   but sometimes we need to supplement project teams with dxw friends. Delivery
   Leads can agree dxw friends day rates as long as the gross margin generated
   exceeds 45%. If the proposed day rate would generate less than a 45% gross
   margin, the rate must be agreed with the relevant Director.

7. **Writing off un-billed time and/or giving service credits**

   These both have a direct adverse impact on our margin, and must be agreed by
   a Director. Any write-offs or service credits are reported quarterly to the
   Company Board.
