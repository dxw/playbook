At dxw, we value people and want them to feel free to be themselves.

We embrace each other's differences, in gender, religion, beliefs, ethnicity,
disability, age, sexual orientation, neurotype, nationality, and identity. We
are diverse - like the people we build, design, and create for.

Amazing things happen when we collaborate together. We work in the open and
believe everyone's voices should be heard.

We recognise individual needs and aim to provide a work environment that is
accessible, welcoming, and empowering for all. We want everyone to feel
supported and included in our wider community.

Our [values](/about-us/our-mission-values-and-principles/#our-values) are more than just words on a page - it’s
about constant action and holding ourselves to account.

We’re committed to being transparent with our diversity information and
regularly assessing the impact of all our policies and practices.

Our approach is set out in our
[Inclusion, diversity and equal opportunities policy](/staff-handbook/policies-and-procedures/inclusion-diversity-equality).

Thank you for being you - it makes us better.
