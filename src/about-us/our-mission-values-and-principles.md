## Our mission

dxw's mission is to:  

1. build services that fit seamlessly into user’s lives, and that make public services usable and accessible to all – especially those most in need  
2. help government to spend less money on technology, so that it can spend more money on the services that society most needs in order to protect its most vulnerable members  
3. use the combination of its experience, technical expertise, public service ethos and [metta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB) not only to produce better services, but to radically and permanently improve people’s interactions with government; to make it a better instrument of good
4. carry out all its work according to sound commercial principles, ensuring that it is profitable, sustainable and able to properly reward its staff and invest in its own growth and improvement

## Our values

We think that it's very important to have a talented team if we're going to
succeed. But just as important as raw talent is our ability to work well
together. These are the values that we aspire to, and help each other to
achieve.

### Helpful

We are helpful, useful and expert. We give practical and pragmatic advice to
each other, and to our clients.

### Positive

We are positive, cheerful and supportive. Even in crisis, we stay optimistic. We
[assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith)
and offer constructive challenge.

### Reliable

We are reliable, consistent and committed. We make every effort to live up to
each others' expectations, and to exceed the expectations of our clients.

### Honest

We are honest, trustworthy and straightforward. We give plain-spoken, frank,
accurate feedback and advice, and we never mislead or obscure the issue at hand.

### Curious

We are curious, diverse and creative. We help each other to learn and improve
and we're sensitive to each others' needs. We love technology and finding new
ways to solve problems.

### Determined

We are determined, discerning and motivated. We believe in high standards, we
enjoy doing things properly, and we're loath to settle for less.

## Our principles

These principles help us live up to our [values](#our-values), and
guide our behaviour and decision making in all the things we do at dxw.

### Start with people and their needs

At dxw we want to create public services that work well for everyone who depends
on them.

We start by understanding the different people who will use and be affected by a
service. Wherever possible we work with them to design and test the things they
will use.

We actively consider the intended and unintended consequences of our work on
people, communities and the planet.

### Keep an agile mindset

At dxw, we think that agile is a mindset that’s accepting of change, curious
about trying new approaches to make things better, and values careful planning
in short chunks.

We think that the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) contains a lot
of wisdom, but we don’t follow the industry of methodologies, training and
certifications that has grown up around it. We think agile is something you
learn to be, not something that you learn to do.

We recognise the importance of compliance and governance, so we build those
activities into each step.

### Work at a sustainable pace

At dxw, we work at a sustainable pace. We estimate work and schedule it
conservatively, and set realistic expectations with clients about the pace of
delivery.

This doesn't mean that we don't work hard. Being productive is a vital part of
maintaining the trust that our clients give us, and it’s important not to let
them down.

### Balance openness and confidentiality

dxw believes it's best to be open about what we're doing. We encourage our
clients to do the same, as does the
[GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). We talk, blog and write
about what we're doing, and we are open about as much as we can.

At dxw, we release [code](https://www.github.com/dxw), publish our
[contracts](https://www.github.com/dxw/contracts) and things like this Playbook
and talk with people about what we're up to because we believe that we'll
ultimately have more opportunities to work, grow and improve than if we kept
everything to ourselves.

However, there are some things that we must keep private.

* Our clients trust us to host content that is not public, like upcoming
  announcements and discussions made as part of formulating new policy. This is
  not our information to be open about, and it's very important to keep it
  confidential.
* We also hold some personal data about and/or on behalf of our clients. We
  never share any of this data, including contact details. See also:
  [data protection](/staff-handbook/data-protection-and-confidentiality).
* We are sometimes sent documents that are
  [protectively marked](/staff-handbook/data-protection-and-confidentiality/#document-labeling),
  and we have a scheme of our own. Information in these documents is
  confidential.
* Information about work that is currently being procured (whether we are
  bidding or not) and any other information that could damage the commercial
  interests of a client or supplier

### Make everything we do accessible

At dxw we want to make sure that everyone can access the services we
create, including our own websites, communications and colleague resources.

We follow the guidance in the
[GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction)
to help us to meet government accessibility requirements.

And to create a consistent and effective approach, we have an [Accessibility Manual](https://accessibility.dxw.com) that provides additional guidance for our different professions.

### Reduce our impact on the environment

It is our responsibility that future communities can thrive. So we will lead by
example, and demonstrate how to make choices that are both people and planet
centred.

We are [carbon neutral](https://www.dxw.com/carbon-reduction-statement/) and
working towards net zero emissions.

We have an
[internal group](https://www.dxw.com/2021/02/what-were-doing-to-reduce-and-offset-our-carbon-footprint/)
who meet regularly to talk about how dxw can respond to the climate and
ecological crisis.
