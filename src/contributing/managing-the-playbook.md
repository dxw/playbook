This is the content strategy for dxw Playbook.

It describes the purpose and users of the Playbook, the kinds of material it
contains, how we manage and update the Playbook, and its current intended
structure.

## Playbook purpose and users

### Agreed ways of working

The primary purpose of the Playbook is to document our current, agreed ways of
working.

This purpose also defines the primary audience and users of the Playbook -
people currently working at dxw. The Playbook should help them work together
efficiently and effectively. Secondary audiences and users of the Playbook are
people working at actual or potential clients, and people who are thinking about
coming to work at dxw. The Playbook should help them understand what it might be
like to work with us.

We also know that people in other organisations look at the Playbook. Although
we donâ€™t create any content specifically for them, the Playbook should leave
like-minded people with a good impression of us.

### Staff policies

The Playbook is also where we publish pay, benefits and other staff policy
information.

This primary audience for this information is people currently working at dxw. A
secondary audience is people who are thinking about coming to work at dxw.

## Playbook content

We divide the Playbook into Topic overviews, Guides and Policies.

### Topic overview

Each section of the Playbook should have some overview material that describes
important values and principles, and lists relevant guides.

We write overview content so that it can be understood by anyone who is likely
to look at the Playbook.

### Guide

A guide describes our current agreement on how we do something. Each guide
should be aimed at a specific group of people and explain how to do a specific
activity.

We write guides to meet the needs of their specific audience and users. While
guides should be clear and simple, they can use subject specific language that
we are confident is understood by the intended audience and users.

### Policy

A policy describes an official company policy and any associated procedures.

We write policies so that they can be easily found, understood and acted on by
all the staff who need to follow them.

## Playbook governance and workflow

### Ownership

Each section of the Playbook has an identified owner, typically either the
director of the relevant part of the business, or the head of the relevant
profession.

The owner is responsible for making sure that their parts of the Playbook:

* continue to reflect our current ways of working and policies
* are findable, readable, understandable and actionable by its intended audience
  and users

The owners of each section are:

* David Mann - [About us](/about-us/)
* Alex Jackson - [The work we do > Finding the right projects](/work-we-do/finding-the-right-projects/)
* Clare Young - [The work we do > Building services](/work-we-do/how-we-deliver-work/)
* Alex Jackson -
  [The work we do > Providing technical support](/work-we-do/providing-techical-support/)
* Wendy Coello -
  [Staff handbook > Talking about what we do](/staff-handbook/talking-about-what-we-do/)
* Poss Apostolou - [Staff handbook](/staff-handbook/)
* Coca Rivas - Our professions

### Workflow

For smaller corrections and updates to the Playbook, staff should consult with
relevant colleagues and follow the
[guide to contributing to the Playbook](/contributing/).

For more significant additions and changes to the Playbook, the steps are:

* the owner of the section and the author agree the need for the update
* the author drafts and reviews the update with appropriate colleagues
* the author follows the
  [guide to contributing to the Playbook](/contributing/)
* the owner and colleagues review and approve the changes

### Review

The owner of each section of the Playbook should lead a review of the sections
they own at least every quarter.

To help facilitate regular review, we should aim for Playbook content to include
last updated and last reviewed dates.

### Coordination

We use the [\#dxw-playbook](https://dxw.slack.com/archives/CK5HUK6SE) Slack
channel to collaborate on the Playbook.

## Playbook style

The Playbook should follow the dxw
[Brand Toolkit](https://v-df7640e636dddb2c9710.brand.madebyfieldwork.com/) and
use the dxw [tone of voice](/staff-handbook/talking-about-what-we-do/tone-of-voice/).
