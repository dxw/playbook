We are currently offering a Flexible Holiday Scheme that allows you to “buy” or “sell” the equivalent of one extra week of holiday each year. This scheme provides more flexibility and control when it comes to using your holiday allowance and aims to help you find a balance between work and your personal commitments in a way that works for you.

We will open a holiday selection window towards the end of the calendar year that allows you to request to buy or sell holiday allowance for the following year.

All dxw staff employed during the period the holiday selection window is open are eligible to participate in the Flexible Holiday Scheme, unless working their notice period.

## **The small print**

It is important that staff take the statutory requirement of 28 days holiday per annum.

We have a legal obligation to pay staff the national minimum wage. If buying additional holiday brings your salary below this threshold you can not participate in the scheme.

The Flexible Holiday Scheme is a discretionary benefit, meaning dxw reserve the right to remove the benefit at any time.

We also reserve the right to refuse your application to buy/sell holiday. We would only do this in exceptional circumstances and would always give you a clear reason as to why we can’t accommodate your request.
