Life assurance is a type of insurance (paid by dxw) which pays a tax free lump sum to nominated beneficiaries in the event you pass away. The lump sum is the equivalent of three times your basic salary.

Clearly this is a benefit that we hope you never have to use, but it does give some financial security to your loved ones, should the worst happen.

You will automatically be enrolled into this benefit when you join dxw.

You can find further information on this benefit, including how to add your nominated beneficiaries, by visiting our [life assurance folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O8f_I3vMyVeVLavkC-yStIm2Ma5tuZWH) in Google Drive.
