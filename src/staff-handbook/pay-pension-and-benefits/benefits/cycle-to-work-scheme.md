Our cycle to work scheme is available once you’ve passed probation, and allows you to hire a bicycle and spread the cost over a period of time through deductions from your monthly salary. You will have the opportunity to purchase the bicycle at the end of the agreement with a small additional payment.

The cycle to work scheme operates on a salary exchange basis, meaning your monthly bicycle hire payments are deducted from your monthly gross salary. This means you save Tax and National Insurance contributions on the full cost of your payments.

You can find further information on this benefit, including how to enrol, by visiting our [cycle to work scheme folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cdOLkDFd-bFz09ap_a5HkyTdlEw4PvTs) in Google Drive.
