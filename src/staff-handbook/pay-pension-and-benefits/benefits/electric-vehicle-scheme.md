Our Electric Vehicle (EV) scheme is available once youâ€™ve passed probation and have reached 12 months service, and allows you to lease an electric vehicle through salary sacrifice, saving you between 30% and 60% of the cost.

With our EV scheme, you get access to a full range of electric vehicles, at the best rates on the market, as well as help selecting the car that best meets your needs and full guidance throughout the process.

The EV scheme operates on a salary exchange basis, meaning your monthly car payments are deducted from your monthly gross salary. This means you save Tax and National Insurance contributions on the full cost of your payments.

You can find further information on this benefit, including how to enrol, by visiting our [electric vehicle scheme folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fClW_p7x5Y3S5oU0Q7wFI3dzEjJ_D2Wh) in Google Drive.
