Our workplace nursery scheme is available once you’ve passed probation, and allows you to save tax and National Insurance on nursery fees from birth up to the age of 5 (or when your child goes to school). dxw will pay your monthly nursery fees directly to your nursery and deduct the equivalent amount from your gross salary.

Nursery fees must be at least £1,000 per month and the amount you can save is not capped, as it is with the Tax-Free Childcare or the Childcare Voucher benefit. This means considerably more savings can be made.

You can find further information on this benefit, including how to enrol, by visiting our [workplace nursery scheme folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YviaRIQpiZU4_V_9BOGaev81P5CwYEme) in Google Drive.
