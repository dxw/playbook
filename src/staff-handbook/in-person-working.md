We need to continuously challenge ourselves to adopt approaches that meet the needs of all employees, wherever we can. The responsibility to act falls to all of us and, as always, this challenge should be demonstrated in a respectful, constructive manner, in line with our values.

We are a remote first organisation but we also understand the immense value of coming together from time-to-time to interact in person and collaborate.

Working together in person is always a choice and not something we enforce. To support anyone who chooses to do so, we have shared offices in Leeds and London, along with access to Landmark co-working spaces across the UK. 

We hold regular all staff meetings online, and occasionally hold all staff get togethers in person. However, we offer online alternatives for those that choose not to attend in person.

For in person get togethers, we trust that our staff will be sensible, respectful and mindful of keeping each other safe. Here are some guiding principles which can help us all to do this:

1. There is no obligation to go into an office or on-site event if there is a risk to your physical or mental health. If you do not feel comfortable meeting up with colleagues in an office environment, just say no. We encourage you to share your needs with your line manager or the People team if it can help us to support you in any way.
2. If you are going into the office or attending an in person work event, be empathetic and apply common sense.

   * If you test positive for Covid, under no circumstances should you go into the office.
   * If you have any symptoms of Covid or any other airborne illness we strongly recommend working from home to reduce the risk to others, especially those who may be more vulnerable.
3. Most of our work is completed remotely, but the occasional in-person meeting can also bring a huge amount of value. The logistics of hybrid working can be complex but we should all look to make meetings as accessible as possible. This could be as simple as sharing information before, during or after the meeting.
4. If you have concerns or questions about any specific circumstances and how they impact you, please speak to your line manager or a member of the People team. We can’t promise we can accommodate every situation, every time, but we will listen and try our best to help wherever possible.
