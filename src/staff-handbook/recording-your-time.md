title: Recording your time

Everyone who works on a client project at dxw is responsible for recording the
time they spend on projects. We usually work with our clients on a
[time and materials basis](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-pay-for-digital-outcomes-and-specialists-services#time-and-materials),
so it’s important we can accurately track and report how our time is spent on
client projects.

We use [Productive](https://app.productive.com/) to schedule our work, which
helps us to forecast our capacity over future weeks and months in a reliable
way.

We track our time at the same level of granularity that we bill it – for almost
everyone in the team, that’s half days or whole days.

## Time recording guidelines

If you:

- worked the time that was scheduled, simply confirm this time
- worked on a named project (client or internal including "dxw Support"),
  that differs from the schedule, record your time as that
- worked on something else, leave the time blank or zero out what you
  were scheduled to work on
- were off sick or on leave, make sure this is recorded on BreatheHR and
  it should be automatically copied across to Productive
- were away due to a regular day off, as part of your working pattern,
  leave the time blank or zero out what you were scheduled to work on

If you’re not doing client work, then unless you’re working on one of a handful
of named internal projects or support, you don’t need to record your time
against any other piece of work – the assumption is you’re doing valuable work,
whether it’s learning, helping with recruitment or improving our tooling and
processes, and we don’t need itemised time tracking to justify that.

We’ve set up the platform, so that it understands individual team members’
working patterns. This means the team don’t need to worry about entering in
their non working days.

Our delivery leads lend a helping hand when delivery team members aren’t sure
how to record their time – they’ve been doing this for a long while and have a
well developed sense for it.
