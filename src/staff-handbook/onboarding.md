After you’ve accepted a role at dxw a member of our People team will be in touch
with you to discuss your laptop, our vetting process and to answer any questions
you may have. On your first day you will receive a welcome Trello which will
tell you who your line manager and helper are, things to read and welcome notes
from the team.

## What your first few days might look like

Below is a rough outline of what to expect from your first two days at dxw.

### Day 1

* Laptop & password set up (led by a tech team member)
* Security chat, password chat & sign documents
* Lunch / Zoom welcome
* HR welcome chat with Passport & P45 check
* Meet your manager

### Day 2

* Helper welcome chat
* Half-day of self-led training (including any help with software)
* Employee led tasks from your Trello

## Calendars

We use Google Workspace to manage calendars, write and share documents. There is
a dxw folder where we share most of the things we write. If you can't see it
when you log in to Google Drive, you'll need to ask someone else to send you the
link, and then click "Add to drive".

## Documents

When we write new things, we try to save them in the most relevant folder within the
existing structure.

## Emails

Please use Helvetica or Arial as the font in your emails.

Here's a suggested format for your email signature:

Name<br> Job Title<br> name@dxw.com<br> Twitter handle - if you’re comfortable
to share<br> Mobile - if you’re comfortable to share<br>

www.dxw.com :: 0345 2577520 :: @dxw :: creating better digital public services

If you need an out of office message on your email account, follow [Gmail's instructions](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/25922)
and include the contact details for another member of the team for any urgent
queries and a return date.


## Probation

New starters are subject to a probation period of 4 months with dxw having the
option to extend by 2 months. Probationary periods go both ways, it is also a
chance for a new employee to find their feet and dxws way of working. In your
probation meeting your line manager will share feedback that they have gathered
from those you have worked with closely.

## Returners' programme

dxw is proud to offer return to work opportunities for experienced hires who are
looking to re-enter the workplace after an extended period of time away.

We’re running a pilot to begin with to see how this works for us and the people
joining us. We’ll start by taking on one or two people for 3 to 6 months -
depending on the role and circumstances. There’s potential to become a permanent
member of the team at the end of the placement, but this isn’t guaranteed.

Initially this opportunity will only be offered within our London team, with a
view to including our Leeds office as the team there grows.

## Who supports you?

You will be supported by our People team from the point of application.

If you’re invited into our recruitment process, it will consist of a one hour
interview followed by a collaborative activity with the team which will be sent
to you 24 hours in advance so you have time to prepare.

The interview will be an informal, semi-structured conversation where there will
be the opportunity for us to learn more about you and your experience and, just
as importantly, for you to get a feel for what it’s like to work at dxw.

If you join us, you’ll be continuously supported by our People team, a line
manager and a mentor within the same field. You‘ll have regular check ins with
the team where you can speak openly about anything that’s on your mind.
