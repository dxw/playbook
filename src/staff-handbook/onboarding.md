After you’ve accepted a role at dxw a member of our People team will be in touch
with you to discuss your onboarding process, including your laptop and our vetting process, and to answer any questions you may have. On your first day you will receive a welcome Trello which will tell you who your line manager and helper are, things to read and welcome notes
from the team.

## What your first few days might look like

Below is a rough outline of what to expect from your first two days at dxw.

### Day 1

* Laptop & password set up (led by a tech team member)
* Security and password chat & sign documents
* Lunch / welcome call
* Meet your manager

### Day 2

* Helper welcome chat
* People team introduction
* Half-day of self-led training (including any help with software)
* Employee led tasks from your Trello

## Calendars

We use Google Workspace to manage calendars, write and share documents. There is
a dxw folder where we share most of the things we write. If you can't see it
when you log in to Google Drive, you'll need to ask someone else to send you the
link, and then click "Add to drive".

## Emails

Here's a suggested format for your email signature:

Name<br> Job Title<br> name@dxw.com<br> Twitter handle - if you’re comfortable
to share<br> Mobile - if you’re comfortable to share<br>

www.dxw.com :: @dxw :: creating better digital public services

If you need an out of office message on your email account, follow [Gmail's instructions](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/25922)
and include the contact details for another member of the team for any urgent
queries, as well as your return to work date.

## Probation

New starters are subject to a probation period of 4 months with dxw having the
option to extend by 2 months. Probationary periods go both ways, it is also a
chance for a new employee to find their feet and dxws way of working. In your
probation meeting your line manager will share feedback that they have gathered
from those you have worked with closely.

## Who supports you?

You will be supported by our People team from the point of application.

You can read more about our recruitment process [here](/staff-handbook/recruitment-process/).

If you join us, you’ll be continuously supported by our People team and a line
manager. You‘ll have regular check ins with a helper where you can speak openly about anything that’s on your mind.
