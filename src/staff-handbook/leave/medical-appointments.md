We support staff who need regular time off for medical appointments or counselling. If you need to attend an appointment, you should talk to your line manager.

For appointments of a couple of hours or so (including travel time), your line manager will usually ask you to try to make the hours up during the week.

If you need to attend a one-off appointment or an appointment for a dependent, let your line manager and Delivery Lead know as far in advance as possible and add this time off to your Google Calendar.

If you are going to be away from work for half a day or more, then please speak with a member of the People team as this may fall under a different process, such as [personal leave](https://playbook.dxw.com/staff-handbook/leave/personal-leave/).

If you need to take time off regularly for recurrent medical appointments, please speak with a member of the People team who will be able to assist you. It may be that this falls under our [personal leave](https://playbook.dxw.com/staff-handbook/leave/personal-leave/) process, or we may look at longer term reasonable adjustments, such as a change in working pattern. We will speak with you about your individual circumstances to make sure we come to the best resolution.
