Personal leave is separate from holiday and sick leave and provides further support and flexibility to employees. This section outlines how the leave can be used and how the leave type works.

## **The basics**

Most leave types will fall under our existing policies, such as holiday and sickness, so please refer to these in the first instance. However, we appreciate that this won’t always be the case. 

To help better support dxw employees, we offer up to two weeks (10 days) of paid personal leave. The leave can be used for various reasons and is requested via the [Personal Leave Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflWNWGOfk8jf71Xm-RQloRuEj-3pMfq5HMheCVV0W_85MvLg/viewform) detailed below. Personal leave will be recorded separately from your holiday and sickness allowances.

If you’re unsure which policy your request applies to, please feel free to reach out to a member of the People team. 

## **Getting support**

Within any rolling 12-month period, a person can receive up to two weeks (10 days) of personal leave. Personal leave is paid leave that can be used on an ad-hoc basis where needed. 

This is pro-rated for staff who work non-standard working patterns. The pro-rated amount is calculated based on the number of days that you work per week.

Here are some ways that personal leave can be used:

* Gender transition
* [Disability](https://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010) - *The definition is set out in section 6 of the Equality Act 2010 which says you’re disabled if: you have a physical or mental impairment. Your impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on your ability to do normal day-to-day activities.* 
* Fertility treatment
* Early pregnancy loss
* Surgery - pre and post-operative 
* Menopause
* Pregnancy-related sickness
* Caring responsibilities

You can still apply for personal leave via the personal leave form if the above reasons do not cover your request. 

Decisions regarding personal leave will be made by your Head Of, and in some cases, your business unit Director. Our aim is to ensure that we’re treating everyone fairly and consistently while being aware of our financial requirements.
