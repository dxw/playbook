The need for compassionate leave is likely to affect many of us at some time or other, in many different ways. Typically compassionate leave covers things like bereavement, or the sudden illness of close relatives and friends. But we understand that loss can manifest itself in other forms which can affect your wellbeing.

This process aims to set some guidance for line managers while also allowing reasonable flexibility to reflect different circumstances.

If you need to take compassionate leave, please let your line manager and a member of the People team know, so we can support you in the right way. If you are on a project, you’ll also need to let your delivery lead know.

In the first instance, line managers can allow up to 3 days of paid compassionate leave. They should consult their director for approval if they think further paid leave may be appropriate in the circumstances.

There is the option for additional time off to be taken using annual or unpaid leave. This should be agreed between the line manager and director, in consultation with the People team. We can also provide support for people returning to work in line with our existing policies and procedures.

Parental bereavement leave is a statutory entitlement of 2 weeks following:

* the death of a child, if they are under the age of 18
* a child who is stillborn after 24 weeks’ pregnancy
* An abortion after 24 weeks - in very limited circumstances an abortion can take place after 24 weeks if the mother’s life is at risk or the child would be born with a severe disability

You can find out more about parental bereavement leave on [the ACAS website](https://www.acas.org.uk/time-off-for-bereavement/parental-bereavement-leave-pay).
