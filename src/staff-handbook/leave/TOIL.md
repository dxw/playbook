Where possible we try to keep a sustainable pace of work and avoid working
outside normal hours; occasionally this might not be possible.

## How TOIL is calculated

TOIL (time off in lieu) is awarded when you work over and above your contracted
working hours continuously for a period of time or when you attend/travel to an
event outside of your contracted working hours. TOIL should be agreed with your
delivery lead or line manager ahead of doing the extra work.

We encourage you to use your TOIL within the two weeks of extra work or event
attended as it's meant to be for resting and making up for working at a
sustainable pace. We know this may not be feasible in every case so please speak
to your Line Manager or a member of the People team if you have any questions.

There are two options of how to use your TOIL, you can calculate the amount of
hours you have accrued (i.e. half a day) and take it off at once or take a couple
of hours a day spread over a period of time. Planning when you’ll take TOIL is
important, particularly if you’re working on a billable project so please speak
to your Delivery Lead before doing any overtime and arrange when you’ll be able
to take the time back.

## Requesting TOIL

Using BreatheHR similar to the way that you request holiday, there is a TOIL
drop down. Go to **My dashboard** and click the link **Log TOIL**,
fill in the form and click the **log TOIL** button. Please write a note as to why
you are requesting the leave and this will be sent to your line manager for
approval. Once approved, your TOIL will be added to your holiday allowance. You
should then book leave as normal to have time not working.
