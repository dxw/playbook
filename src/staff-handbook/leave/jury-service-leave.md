If you receive a jury summons letter, please let the People team know as soon as you can and provide them with a digital copy of your jury summons. You should also let your line manager and delivery lead know when your jury service is expected to start.

Jury service leave is generally paid for each day (or part thereof) that you are required to attend court.

If you are required to complete jury service, dxw will pay your normal salary less £64.95 per day. Once you have completed jury service you are able to claim back the £64.95 per day towards your loss of earnings, and any care or childcare outside of your usual arrangements. You can find out more about [what you can claim on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/jury-service/what-you-can-claim-if-youre-an-employee).

The People team will complete a [loss of earnings form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/claim-a-loss-of-earnings-or-benefit-during-jury-service) for you, and will share this with you ahead of the first day of your summons.

If the case you are assigned to exceeds 4 weeks, the impact on your pay will be reviewed by Directors and a decision will be made on the pay you will receive during this time.
