We offer 25 days of holiday plus bank holidays (England entitlement) each calendar year. If you are working part-time or on a fixed-term contract, the amount of holiday you are entitled to will be pro-rated.

The holiday year at dxw runs between 1st January and 31st December, and you are able to carry over up to a maximum of 5 days of unused holiday to the following year. This carry over will be pro-rated for anyone on a part-time or non standard working pattern.

## Booking holiday

1. Discuss the dates with your line manager, team and, if you’re in a billable role , your Delivery Lead.This gives them a chance to manage any impact it might have on the wider team and the project.
2. Request your holiday through BreatheHR.We use BreatheHR to track who’s off and when, so we can plan for it. Once you’ve requested holiday, your line manager will review your request.
3. Once your holiday is approved, add it to your Google calendar as ‘Out of office’.\
   When you are on a client project, you may also need to add your holiday to a shared or team calendar. Please check this with your Delivery Lead.
4. Set your Slack status to ‘On holiday’. Do this when you finish on your last day before your holiday, and set it to clear when you come back.

## Holiday approval

Your line manager will normally approve requests of:

* More than 2 days, where the request is made with at least 4 week’s notice
* 2 days or less, where the request has been made with 1 week's notice

Any requests that are made with less notice will still be considered by your line manager, but the impact on client, team and personal workloads will need to be taken into account.

When your holiday request has been approved, it will automatically sync across to Productive. Each member of our delivery team uses the tool to record the days they work on client projects on a weekly basis.
