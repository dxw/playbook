We aim to offer as much flexibility as possible for our staff, often this is achieved through an alternative working pattern. Our approach is informed by the way we work and the way we charge clients for our time.

Our standard working pattern is 5 days per week, Monday to Friday, and 7 hours per day (excluding a break for lunch).

If you have an alternative working arrangement, you should make sure it’s reflected in your calendar so the rest of the team can be confident in knowing when you are and aren’t around.



## Requesting a change of working pattern

A change to your working pattern could include changing to a part time working pattern (fewer days, or fewer hours per day), or a compressed working pattern (full time hours over fewer days).

We are happy to consider any working pattern you think will work for you, but we cannot guarantee we will always be able to accommodate your request.

Any changes to your working pattern must be sustainable for your wellbeing, productivity and the needs of the role. We will always give you clear feedback if we don’t think we can accommodate your request and discuss any alternative solutions with you.

You can request a change to your working pattern once every 6 months and we may recommend a trial period for any new working pattern. During this time you and your line manager will catch up regularly to check the change is working for you, and dxw, without a more permanent change to your contract.

If you would like to request a change to your working pattern, first speak to your line manager. They will discuss your request, and help you to think about any potential impact on you, the team and your work. They may also speak to your Delivery Lead, Director or the People team to help with this.

Once you’ve decided you would like to progress with a new flexible working pattern, please fill in the [change of working pattern request form](https://forms.gle/qA1BwvQenqtVzShF8) and the People team will review this, ahead of confirming your request has been accepted and making any changes to BreatheHR or payroll. You will also receive paperwork outlining the changes. We ask for at least 4 week’s notice for any change to a working pattern.



## Annual leave impact

If your role is part time your salary and holiday allowances (including bank holidays) will be prorated.

For example, when working a 4 day week at 7 hours per day, the pro rata leave allowance will be 20 days per year of annual leave and 6.5 bank holiday days, giving a total leave allowance of 26.5 days.

The People team will book any bank holidays that fall on a working day as annual leave in [BreatheHR](https://login.breathehr.com/login) on your behalf.

If a bank holiday falls on a non working day then this day will be available in your bookable annual leave allowance to be taken at another point in the annual leave year.
