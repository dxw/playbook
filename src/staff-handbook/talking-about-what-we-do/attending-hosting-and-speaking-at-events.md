## Attending events

We all go to work-related events and conferences, sometimes for work and
sometimes in our personal time.

No matter what capacity you’re attending an event in, you are a representative
of dxw. What you say and do will influence the way people think about the
company. It’s important that you make a positive impression and follow the code
of conduct for the event.

We encourage everyone to network and talk about dxw’s work. Remember to tell
people if we’re hiring and point them to our careers page on the dxw website.

## Hosting events

We host a variety of face to face and online events to share our experience and
expertise.

We work hard to design events that are [accessible, inclusive and safe](https://www.dxw.com/2023/08/inclusion-ukcharitycamp/). We ask
attendees about their individual access and support needs.

We publish a code of conduct for all the events we host. And we expect the hosts
of events we are involved in to apply similar standards to the conduct of their
sponsors, event organisers and participants.

## Speaking at events

Speaking at events is a great opportunity to represent dxw.

If it’s an event around your personal speciality (front-end development, sysops,
UX etc), feel free to stick to any personal branding, slide format, or talk
style you might have already developed. At the start of your talk however,
please introduce yourself as being from dxw, talk about what the company does,
and what you do here.

If it’s an event more around dxw’s focus (public sector events, dxw projects,
public-sector specific topic etc) you should use
[dxw’s branding and slide templates](https://v-df7640e636dddb2c9710.brand.madebyfieldwork.com/).
Introduce the company in full and what your role is.

It takes time to prepare talks that work well. If you need help or advice please
ask for it in the [\#dxw-marketing](https://dxw.slack.com/archives/C0K5DRKU6)
channel on Slack.

dxw doesn’t have many secrets, but some of our customers do. You should be mindful of information security when planning a talk, and remember this also applies when chatting at a conference or sharing with your peers from outside dxw. Be careful that a good anecdote doesn’t breach security.

It’s also good to blog after the event, to share the content or to talk about
your experience and what you learned.

If you need time to be set aside to prepare or follow up a talk, talk to your
delivery lead and see what’s possible.
