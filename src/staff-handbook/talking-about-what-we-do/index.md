We blog, write case studies, speak at events and use social media to let people know about:

* the work that dxw does
* how we do it
* our expertise
* the wider team
* our culture

This helps to:

* raise our profile with clients we want to work with
* reinforce whatâ€™s unique about us
* show our leadership, work and expertise across the sector
* promote dxw as an employer
