The marketing team run dxw’s official social media accounts, which are currently on [Linkedin](https://uk.linkedin.com/company/dxw), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nuthqzyo733a4nuyw3cteisd) and Threads.

When we post we use the dxw [tone of voice](/staff-handbook/talking-about-what-we-do/tone-of-voice/).

We encourage people to work openly and share the work they’re doing, their learning and ideas from their own accounts. You should be careful not to disclose any confidential or sensitive information and check that people have given their permission before publishing any pictures of them.

Remember that you are representing dxw whether or not you identify yourself as working here in your profile.
