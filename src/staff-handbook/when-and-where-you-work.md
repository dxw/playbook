## Working hours

Our working hours are 10:00-18:00, Monday to Friday. Some people work different
hours by arrangement. Anyone is free to do that as long as their hours of work
don't make it hard for other people to get things done. For example, many people start earlier than 10:00 and finish earlier, which is generally fine.

Each team has a short standup every morning, where we each tell the whole team
about a single thing we will get done that day. If you think you're going to be
late, you should let everyone know in the project Slack channel.

We do our very best to
[work at a sustainable pace](/about-us/our-mission-values-and-principles/#work-at-a-sustainable-pace). But
sometimes, when we're approaching a firm deadline or a launch, or a client is
having an emergency, we work longer hours than normal. From time to time,
there's an emergency that means we have to work during unsociable hours to solve
the problem. Neither of these happen very often, but they are a normal part of
life at dxw.

Sending emails or posting in Slack outside of working hours can be a good way to
get things off your mind, but it can create an unintended sense of urgency for
the people who receive your message. Try to avoid creating that urgency when
it’s not necessary. For example, by specifically saying that you don’t expect an
immediate response.

Unless they are actually urgent, you can ignore messages you receive outside of
working hours and handle them when you are back at work.

## Working on client projects

We charge clients “time and materials” for the work we do, based on a
[per person day rate](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-10/documents/92768/432689933684667-sfia-rate-card-2018-05-23-1413.pdf).

We generally schedule team members to work on particular projects for a whole
two week sprint at a time, and track and bill that time in half days and whole
days. Delivery leads work with the finance team to track and invoice the time of
the team; having regularly patterned working helps the process to run as
smoothly as possible, without confusion and without taking more time than
needed. Any working arrangement needs to make it straightforward to track,
report and invoice for your time.

When working on a project we work as a single multi-disciplinary team. We’re
often working on phases of projects where there’s a lot of unknowns and a lot of
learning, so we use agile approaches and strongly favour being able to work
together on problems. That’s often easier when co-located, particularly when
working with clients, pairing, or participating in workshops. Any working
arrangement needs to support active synchronous collaboration with the team.

## Internal teams

Internal facing roles, in which time is not billable to a client, have a more
regularly structured full- or part-time working week.

We encourage people in internal facing roles to take part in dxw time activities
to contribute to our culture and to improve our ways of working.

## dxw time

We regularly come together to work on our own projects and processes.

This dxw time is important for us to maintain our strong culture and identity,
and to improve our practices, separate from the clients we work for.

## Working from home

We are able to work successfully in a remote capacity, from our homes. On
occasions, it may be necessary to work from one of our office spaces, a client
location or another location approved by dxw in order to complete a specific
task. It is important that you remain contactable and productive.

## Working from overseas

We have a [policy on working from overseas](/staff-handbook/policies-and-procedures/working-from-overseas-policy).
