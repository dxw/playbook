## Purpose

The purpose of the dxw pay policy is to give us a framework to pay salaries at
the highest level we can, in the fairest way possible and in the most
sustainable way for the long-term commercial health of the business. Alongside
our mission and values, and the way we look after and develop our teams, it’s an
important part of us being able to attract and retain great people.

## Principles

The following principles underpin the policy:

- Transparency
- Parity amongst similar roles
- Equality of pay for those with the same role
- Clear levels of responsibility and accountability
- Clear career progression

## How the policy works

1. Applies to all staff in both billable and non billable teams. Statutory
   directors will each have a performance framework that is independent from
   this policy.
2. Billable team pay has published pay points per level, that are based on 3
   main factors:

   - [Skills for the Information Age (SFIA)](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-12/documents/92768/886204607156866-sfia-rate-card-2020-07-17-1338.pdf)
     standards and rates which clients use to measure dxw against
   - profitability margins based on expected billable rates
   - the labour market and salaries based on this

3. Non billable team pay has published pay bands that are based fundamentally on
   the labour market, but could also include other factors such as professional
   qualifications and sales targets.
4. Each director is responsible for overseeing pay for their teams and has
   overall responsibility for justifying decisions against the principles and
   criteria in this policy. This policy will be reviewed at least every 2 years.
   The review will take place between October and February, to avoid changes to
   salaries shortly before the annual CPI rise. Any changes to pay points /
   bands will be subject to approval by the dxw board.
5. For roles equivalent to
   [SFIA levels 1-5](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-12/documents/92768/886204607156866-sfia-rate-card-2020-07-17-1338.pdf)
   we would expect promotions or pay changes to be handled within the team based
   on the progression framework, with a director or delegated head of taking
   responsibility for this
6. For roles that are more senior i.e.
   [SFIA level 6](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-12/documents/92768/886204607156866-sfia-rate-card-2020-07-17-1338.pdf)
   equivalent or above we would expect the board to consider these, with
   internal interview panels to help make a decision (where necessary)
7. Everyone should have an annual review of their performance and career
   progression and pay as a minimum after passing probation. It's up to each
   line manager to arrange more frequent check-ins on progression, so that the
   outcome of the annual review is not a surprise
8. Line managers are responsible for ensuring that all staff are given equal
   opportunities, and pay discussions are fair and inclusive. If staff would
   like an independent opinion in these discussions, they should contact the
   People team in the first instance who can facilitate.
9. dxw works with an independent HR advisor, who can assist if needed to help
   resolve any issues.

## Cost of living

10. London weighting of £4,000 per year applies to staff who earn under £40,000
    per year to help them with the additional costs of living in London.

    - This applies to people who live in a London borough.
    - If someone’s salary increases above this level, London weighting will
      gradually taper off (by £500 for each £1000 of extra salary) between
      £40,000 and £48,000
    - The rationale for these numbers is taken from Trust for London research
      which shows London weighting materially benefits people on salaries under
      £40,000.
    - It is subject to tax & NI and is not pensionable
    - It is a fixed rate, not uplifted by CPI

11. Annual cost of living CPI rises will apply for staff if the company achieves
    turnover above its minimum target for the preceding financial year.

    - If you’ve passed your probation then you’ll receive your raise in October
      payroll
    - CPI rises will not apply to people who for historic reasons are above the
      maximum pay level for their role, to help us gradually align salaries for
      similar roles
    - If someone is under formal disciplinary or performance procedures, their
      CPI rise will be postponed while this is ongoing
    - The CPI figure comes from published Office of National Statistics data

12. We are committed to paying the London living wage or higher for all staff.

### Cost of living raise

dxw will institute a cost of living raise each year on 1st October. The
percentage will be set by the
[CPI Index](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices) as of 1st
October each year.

- Annual cost of living CPI rises will apply for staff if the company achieves
  turnover above its minimum target for the preceding financial year.
- If you have passed your probation, you will receive your raise in the October
  payroll.
- For those team members who joined prior to 1st October of that year, but
  haven't yet passed probation, you will receive your raise in the month you
  successfully complete it and it will be the same percentage as of 1st October
  CPI that year.
- If you joined on or after 1st October (that year), you will not be eligible
  for a cost of living raise until the following October.
- If you are leaving during October you will not receive the cost of living
  raise.
