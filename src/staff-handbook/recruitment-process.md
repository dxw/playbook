## Making a plan for hiring

The hiring lead works with the People team to create a plan for hiring using
[the hiring doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oN961FE41BWPyrVrPbHCES2D78eB0nbVp7dxZzHkMb8/edit).
This includes planning for each stage of recruitment by doing the following;

* set up the roles in [Applied](https://www.beapplied.com/) where we manage the
  hiring process
* write our sifting and interview questions, and their review guides
* work out who will be part of the hiring team and try to make sure that
  interview panels are diverse

## Writing a job description

Before deciding to advertise a new job, we try to write an inclusive job
description. The hiring lead will work with heads of professions, the hiring
team, and the People team to make sure that they’ve gathered what they need and to
get feedback on it. We’ve written about our approach to job descriptions here
[on our blog](https://www.dxw.com/2021/01/how-to-write-inclusive-job-descriptions/).

We always include a salary band in the job description.

Once the hiring lead has a first draft they will put the job description through
[The Gender Decoder](https://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/) and make relevant
changes before sharing with the Diversity and Inclusion group for a final
review.

We then publish the job advert on
[our careers page](https://www.dxw.com/careers/).

## Finding people

We sometimes find people through our networks, and share our jobs on Twitter and
LinkedIn.

We also always advertise on specialist jobs boards as relevant. We have a budget
to advertise roles and encourage hiring leads to think about how they could use
this to attract more diverse applicants. We use the following job boards:

* [Hustle Crew](https://www.hustlecrew.co/)
* [Coding Black Females](https://codingblackfemales.com/)
* [Ada's List](https://www.adaslist.co/)
* [Escape the City](https://www.escapethecity.org/)

We typically don’t use recruiters.

We always welcome general applications if there’s not an open vacancy.

## Reviewing applications

The hiring lead and the hiring team review applications to decide who to take
forward.

We check whether applicants might be able to carry out the job description, and
decide whether to take them to the next stage.

We always inform candidates if they are not being taken to the next stage.

## Sifting questions

All candidates are required to answer sifting questions as part of their
application. These questions are written by the hiring team and are a chance for
candidates to explain their skillset by answering role specific questions.

## Interviewing

Interviews are an hour long with two members of the team. Candidates have a
choice of Google Meet or Zoom as their platform to interview on.

dxw interviews are informal. They are a semi-structured conversation. We use
competency-based questions, and look for answers that describe a candidate’s own
experience.

Interviewers should take notes during the interview.

We include time in interviews for candidates to ask questions, whether about
dxw, the role, or the process. We will always try to answer, but we will check
things if we need to and get back to them.

Directly after an interview, the interviewers will add their notes to Applied
without discussing the candidate first. Once all of the interviews are
completed, the hiring team will meet to discuss who will progress to the next
stage.

If a candidate is not being taken to the next stage, we will provide detailed
feedback from the interview.

## Simulating a work day

A work sim (simulated work day) is a 2-3 hour activity based on a real world problem or
task. We use this to make sure that a candidate is capable of taking on a role.
We also find out about how a candidate approaches their work. It also gives the
candidate the chance to meet more people they would be working with and to
understand more about the role, how we work, and the expectations of the job
itself.

Whether or not you're asked do a work sim, and the kind of activity you'll do, depends on the role you applied for. For technical roles,
this might involve pairing with one of our developers, and for delivery roles,
running a planning session for a team. The activity will always involve working
in conjunction with someone in a similar role to the one the candidate is
applying for.

We send candidates the task and an explanation at least 24 hours before the work
day, so that they have a chance to read and understand the scope of the
activity, to prepare anything they need to, or to pull out if they don’t feel
like they are a good fit.

At the end of a work day, we ask the candidate to briefly and informally present
their activity to a small group.

After all work days are completed, the hiring team will meet. For candidates who
have not been successful, we will provide detailed feedback from the interview
and work day.

## Making a job offer

When we are ready to offer a job, the People team will call and email the
candidate with the details of the offer, including salary and a proposed start
date. If the candidate accepts the offer, we start the onboarding process. If
they have queries, the People team will discuss them with them and make
adjustments where possible and appropriate.

Offers are subject to successfully completing eligibility to work in the UK
checks and a background check including BPSS and BS7858. We need to do this
vetting due to restrictions in our client contracts.
