We're committed to supporting learning and development at individual, team and company level.

Everyone is able to use 4 days annually for their own personal development. 

**While the £1,000 individual allowance is not currently available,** we have a ring-fenced budget for learning and development which is allocated based on an assessment of the skills and knowledge gaps which align most closely with our business needs.

If you have any questions, please talk to your line manager or contact the People team.
