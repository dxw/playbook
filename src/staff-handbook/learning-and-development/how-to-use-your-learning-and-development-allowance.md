At dxw, we want everyone to feel supported in their career and have the chance to grow in ways that are meaningful to them. Our approach to career development includes regular check-ins, dedicated conversations about your growth, and tools to help track progress and performance over time.

This page gives an overview of how we approach career development at dxw, with links to more detailed resources and templates. Whether you're a new starter, an experienced team member, or stepping into a line management role, this guidance is here to help.



## Our approach

Career development at dxw is based on open, regular and honest conversations. These conversations help us:

* Reflect on progress, challenges and achievements
* Provide feedback - both positive and developmental
* Understand goals and aspirations
* Identify learning needs or blockers
* Align personal development with dxw’s direction and values



## Key elements & resources

Here’s how we support this approach:



### Career development conversations

Dedicated discussions focused on your performance and growth. These happen at least every 6 months, but can be more frequent depending on individual preference. They’re a chance to reflect, receive feedback, and set or review goals. 

You can find further information and resources on career development conversations in our [All Staff - Career Development folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ut02O34od7dU3ryLVfdXd2XxVt8FmPe2?usp=drive_link) in Google Drive.



### Regular 1:1s

These are shorter, more frequent catch-ups with your line manager. They provide space to talk about priorities, raise concerns, reflect on progress, and receive support. At dxw, 1:1s should take place at least fortnightly.

You can find further information and resources on effective 1:1s in our [All Staff - Career Development folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ut02O34od7dU3ryLVfdXd2XxVt8FmPe2?usp=drive_link) in Google Drive.

### Quarterly check-in form for managers

A quarterly form helps line managers track performance and development over time. In addition to helping us understand individual performance, it also helps us make more proactive decisions around progression. It’s short and simple, allowing more time to be focused on having good quality development conversations. This form and guidance for completion will be shared with line managers by the People team on a quarterly basis. 

## For team members

As a team member, here’s what you can expect:

* A dedicated conversation about your development and goals at least every six months
* Regular 1:1s with your manager to raise challenges, receive feedback and stay aligned on priorities
* Written notes or templates to help keep track of goals, actions and progress
* A supportive environment where feedback is shared openly and constructively

Everyone’s preferences around how often to meet, how feedback is shared, and how conversations are documented may differ - so speak with your manager about what works best for you.

## For line managers

If you manage people, your role is to support their development as well as their day-to-day work. This includes:

* Scheduling career development conversations at least twice a year
* Supporting regular, high-quality 1:1s
* Giving clear, constructive and balanced feedback
* Using our templates to record and revisit goals and progress
* Submitting the quarterly check-in form for each direct report

If you’re not sure how best to approach a conversation, or would like help with giving feedback or supporting progression, the People team is here to support you.
