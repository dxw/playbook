We may pay for a qualification or training that exceeds the [annual £1,000 individual learning and development allowance](/staff-handbook/learning-and-development/how-to-use-your-learning-and-development-allowance/), when that course is relevant and
helpful to both dxw and the individual. This is a benefit that comes into effect
once you have passed your probationary period.

We will agree to pay on the understanding that if you leave dxw, you may be
liable to repay some, or all, of the fees and expenses incurred.

Other than in exceptional circumstances, which will be decided at the Directors’
discretion, you will be required to repay dxw if you leave the company:

* before you attend the course, you will repay 100% of the
  costs that dxw cannot recover from the course provider.
* during the course or within 9 months of completing it, you
  will repay 75% of the costs.
* more than 9 months and no more than 12 months after
  completing the course, you will repay 50% of the costs.
* more than 12 months after completing the course, no repayment
  will be required.

We appreciate that these percentages won’t always work given the length of the
qualification, so the final percentage will be at the discretion of the
Directors and will be agreed with the individual before approval of the
course.

You will not be required to repay any costs in the following circumstances:

* compulsory or voluntary redundancy
* retirement due to sickness
