Line management at dxw is not about hierarchy, it’s about providing professional
guidance and support.

Line managers help set expectations so team members are clear about their role and responsibilities at dxw. They also provide feedback and support so individuals can fulfil these to the best of their ability. Individuals should be proactive in taking responsibility for their own development, but line managers will provide advice and support to help team members meet their agreed short and long term goals.

## Line management principles

### Communicate clearly

Communication is a two-way process and it is important to check understanding
and confidence, and value the other person in decision-making. Explaining the
task and its objectives clearly means people know what’s expected of them and
the part they play. It empowers them to take responsibility and own how they
approach the work.

### Recognise achievement and celebrate success

A simple ‘thank you’ shows someone that what they have done is appreciated, and
is hugely motivating. Celebrating major, and minor, achievements is an important
part of our culture at dxw. It builds team spirit and morale.

### Guard our values

Lead by example. The actions and behaviours of line managers must always
demonstrate our dxw values. We should always hold ourselves accountable to our
values, and encourage the same in all of our colleagues, including those we line
manage.

### Continuous constructive feedback

Find out how each of your team members prefers to receive feedback, and develop
an approach which reflects that. Ongoing positive and constructive feedback is
essential if someone is to feel valued, learn from their experiences and become
better at what they do.

### Be honest

Being honest means telling the truth and being consistent in what you say and
who you say it to. Telling things as they are, while being sensitive to the
situation and individual, ensures that people know where they stand and will
help to build mutual trust and respect.

### Wellbeing

Line managers look out for the health and wellbeing of the team. They are
responsible for carrying out dxw's duty of care to its people.

## Career growth and performance 

Supporting career growth and development of your team members is an important part of being a line manager. This will involve regular 1-1s, career development conversations and completing a short form to help track performance on a quarterly basis.

For more detailed guidance on supporting your team’s growth, please read the [Career Development and Growth guidance section](https://playbook.dxw.com/staff-handbook/learning-and-development/how-to-use-your-learning-and-development-allowance/).

## Support for line managers

The role of a line manager is important. They should be an ally and advocate for their team members, so it’s critical that they feel supported in this role.

The People team supports line managers with advice and guidance on a range of things, including; recruitment, onboarding, probation, performance, sickness and any other specialist knowledge.

Each month the People team holds a session dedicated to line management, where they share information, answer questions and offer support on a range of topics. To ensure line managers get the most from these sessions, giving feedback on the content and discussion points is encouraged.
