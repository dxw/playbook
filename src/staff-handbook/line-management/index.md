Line management at dxw is not about hierarchy, it’s about providing professional
guidance and support.

Line managers ensure that team members are clear about their roles and
responsibilities at dxw, and how well they are doing at achieving them.

Individuals should be proactive in taking responsibility for their own
development, but line managers will provide advice and support to help team
members meet their agreed short and long term goals.

The People team support line managers with advice and guidance on recruitment, onboarding,
probation, performance, sickness and any other specialist knowledge.

You can find out who your line manager is in BreatheHR on the summary section of
your profile page.

## Line management principles

### Communicate clearly

Communication is a two-way process and it is important to check understanding
and confidence, and value the other person in decision-making. Explaining the
task and its objectives clearly means people know what’s expected of them and
the part they play. It empowers them to take responsibility and own how they
approach the work.

### Recognise achievement and celebrate success

A simple ‘thank you’ shows someone that what they have done is appreciated, and
is hugely motivating. Celebrating major, and minor, achievements is an important
part of our culture at dxw. It builds team spirit and morale.

### Guard our values

Lead by example. The actions and behaviours of line managers must always
demonstrate our dxw values. We should always hold ourselves accountable to our
values, and encourage the same in all of our colleagues, including those we line
manage.

### Continuous constructive feedback

Find out how each of your team members prefers to receive feedback, and develop
an approach which reflects that. Ongoing positive and constructive feedback is
essential if someone is to feel valued, learn from their experiences and become
better at what they do.

### Be honest

Being honest means telling the truth and being consistent in what you say and
who you say it to. Telling things as they are, while being sensitive to the
situation and individual, ensures that people know where they stand and will
help to build mutual trust and respect.

### Wellbeing

Line managers look out for the health and wellbeing of the team. They are
responsible for carrying out dxw's duty of care to its people.

## One-to-ones with your line manager

### Purpose

For your manager to help you with your personal and professional development,
your wellbeing, and to build a trusting relationship between the two of you.

### Overview

These meetings are about you; ideally you will feel happy driving the meeting.
If you’re not confident doing this, or are unsure how best to approach it, your
manager will help you to get there.

### Agenda and topics

Coming to your 1:1s with a list of things you’d like to discuss will help you
make the most of the time. Some things you might find productive to talk about
include:

* **Your career and growth goals:** Don’t assume your manager knows all your
  aspirations. Bring them up in your 1:1s. Your manager understands you won’t
  work for them forever and they want you to have a happy, fulfilling career —
  whatever that means to you. Tip: if you want to talk about your long-term
  goals but feel uneasy about it, ask your manager to do the same.
* **Team improvement:** Have an idea that will help your team to work better?
  Use your manager as a sounding board to help you refine and implement your
  suggestion.
* **Self improvement:** Got a specific thing you’d like some help, coaching or
  feedback on? A technical skill or a soft skill? Your 1:1 is the place to bring
  it up. Remember that you can use the 1:1s that fall between career progression
  reviews to discuss any of the proficiencies you’re currently trying to level
  up on.
* **Personal issues:** Anything going on outside of work that’s affecting your
  wellbeing? Physical or mental illness, bereavement, family issues, stress? The
  more you can tell your manager, the more they can try to help, and make
  accommodations for you at work.
* **Interpersonal issues:** Having problems with a coworker? Your manager can
  help mediate or coach you through how to deal with the issue.
* **Retrospection:** If at any time you feel like your 1:1s aren’t particularly
  productive or helpful, or you’d like to change something about them, don’t
  hesitate to bring this up with your manager.

### Frequency

1:1s should happen at least once per fortnight. Where possible they’ll be
face-to-face, either in the office or out for a walk, or a coffee. Where that’s
not possible, remote is perfectly fine. There’ll always be a Google Meet link in
the calendar invite.

If you need to reschedule your 1:1, let your manager know at the earliest
opportunity.

### Meeting length

An hour or so, at least once every two weeks, is a good standard to aim for. If
you meet weekly, a little shorter is fine.
