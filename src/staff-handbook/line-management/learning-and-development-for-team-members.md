## Development for your team members

Part of your work will be to help your team members grow and develop. You should be having regular 1:1s and career development conversations with them to: 

* Understand their ambitions and learning needs
* Track goals and provide regular feedback
* Create space and support for development opportunities

You should:

* Schedule career development conversations at least once every 6 months with your team members
* Discuss learning needs regularly in 1:1s
* Review and prioritise development goals together — whether for their current role, a future role, personal growth, or long-term ambitions
* Share information about your team’s learning needs with your Head Of or the People team, who will proactively look for ways and opportunities to help people develop. This may include use of the directed learning and development budget or dedicated time off for learning and development purposes.
