At dxw we have an [information security management system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccBz3KEgEFZqHyfD2wa28LDj1IpIlxWJLXJMSG_-1xo/edit?usp=drive_link) that helps us to look after all the information we control. It instructs and guides us all in how we keep data safe for ourselves and our clients.

Though dxw doesn't control much personal data, our clients generally do. And
some of it may be held on sites that we host. Everyone at dxw has a
responsibility to keep that data safe, and process it in accordance with the
[data protection principles](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act).

In particular, we:

* only process personal data as part of work on the service that we're
  contracted to provide to a client
* don't access personal data unless we need to in order to do our jobs: don't
  read people's personal data or private communications without good reason
* we do not ever disclose people's personal data to anyone outside dxw unless
  specifically instructed, and are satisfied that it is legal to do so

If you have any questions about data protection, talk to the Data Protection
Officer, Gurps.

## Information security at dxw

Our information security management system (ISMS) is what we use to ensure we look after the data we have access to. We structure and run this system to be compliant with the ISO 27001 standard, to which we are [externally assessed](https://certcheck.ukas.com/certified-entity/576f1903-1190-5342-b525-37ae686b8fd1). Our ISMS team has the responsibility of owning our ISMS and is always evolving and improving it. They do this with the help of our directors and specialists at URM consulting. Together they help us manage risks to the security of our data. 

If you have any questions about either our ISMS or the safety of our data, talk to the ISMS team.

You can find our Information security policy and current members of the ISMS team in the [ISMS manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccBz3KEgEFZqHyfD2wa28LDj1IpIlxWJLXJMSG_-1xo/edit?usp=drive_link). (we have two versions of this, this one that is suitable for sharing outside dxw as it has some contact details redacted) 

## Document labeling

This guidance is supported by the [Documents policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lynCayxE4PyMWXCBIgWcMHSLUIEySuNq1uTNrpC1yxs/edit?usp=sharing), which is available to be viewed by dxw staff.

Some information that we have is confidential. We use a protective marking
scheme so that everyone understands how to handle this material, and who they're
allowed to disclose it to. All of the documents and data we hold will fall into
one of the categories below.

* **Management-in-Confidence**: internal documents whose circulation within dxw
  needs to be restricted.
* **Company Confidential**: information owned by dxw which would be of value to
  those outside the company, such as competitors, and whose loss or theft would
  potentially damage the company.
* **Client Confidential** or **Commercial in Confidence**: information owned by
  dxw or its clients, which needs to remain confidential between dxw and the
  client.
* **Unclassified**: information, which would not be of significant commercial
  value to those outside dxw.

Some of our clients also have protective marking schemes. For example, all
central government bodies will apply the
[Government Protective Marking System (GPMS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications).
If you are in possession of materials that are protectively marked using other
schemes, treat them as company confidential.

We take care to handle all data carefully, but when information is protectively
marked, extra requirements apply.

Because we value openness highly, we take care not to over-classify information.
We don't protectively mark information unless there is a good reason to keep it
confidential.

### Management-in-confidence

This category is used only for dxw's most confidential information. For example,
employment records, salary details and company strategy documents.

Do not share any information with this marking with any person, whether internal
or external to dxw.

This information:

* must be clearly labelled or described as "Management-in-confidence"
* when printed

  * stored only in a locked container
  * transported only via courier, recorded delivery or personally by dxw staff
  * destroyed by cross-cut shredding when no longer required
* when digital

  * stored in an encrypted format
  * communicated only when encrypted or via an encrypted connection, unless
    emailed from one dxw.com address to another

### Company Confidential

This category is used for information which should not be communicated outside
dxw. For example, details about how we operate security controls or internal
discussions about client work.

Exactly the same controls apply to this information as detailed under
Management-in-confidence, with the exception that Company Confidential
information can be shared within dxw as required.

### Client Confidential or Commercial in Confidence

This category is used for information which is disclosed to a limited group of
people external to dxw, or which is unclassified information we have received
from clients. For example, dxw proposals, presentations for pitches or planning
documents.

Unless otherwise specified, all unclassified information we receive from clients
falls into this category.

This information:

* must be clearly labelled or described as "Client Confidential" or "Commercial
  in Confidence"
* when printed:

  * stored out of sight
  * destroyed by cross-cut shredding when no longer required
* when digital:

  * stored in an encrypted format when on exchangeable media or a mobile device

As a rule of thumb, label a document as Client Confidential if it mostly
contains the client's confidential information, or Commercial in Confidence if
it mostly contains dxw's.

### Unclassified

Anything not captured by the sections above is unclassified. Examples are
external marketing material, general emails and letters.

Beyond a general duty to treat information carefully, unclassified information
is not subject to any specific restrictions.
