This policy provides guidance and outlines parental leave entitlement depending on individual circumstances. Please speak with a member of the People team if you have any questions.

While many terms around parental leave are gendered, at dxw we only need to know whether you will be the primary or secondary carer. 

We make a distinction based on whether you are a primary carer (the person who will be on parental leave for a longer period of time) or a secondary carer (the person who will be returning to work first) as there will be differences in both the statutory and dxw entitlement.

## Understanding your entitlement

We’ve detailed the different entitlements that dxw offer in each section, and there’s an [online calculator](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-paternity-pay-leave) for working out your statutory entitlement. If you’d like support working out your anticipated time off and accompanying types of pay, please speak to the People team.

## Holiday accrual

You will continue to accrue holiday while you are on parental leave and any bank holidays that you miss will be added to your holiday entitlement when you return to work. You can choose to use this holiday before or after your parental leave if you wish.
