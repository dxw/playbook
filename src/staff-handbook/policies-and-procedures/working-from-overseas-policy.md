dxw is a UK-based business, with staff working from locations around the UK.

In general you cannot work from abroad for any period of time, and you must inform your line manager and delivery lead if you plan to be abroad and not on leave.

Most of our client contracts require our staff and contractors to be based in the UK, and for dxw there are usually significant overheads involved in complying with local employment laws, registering for and paying the relevant taxes.

If you believe there are exceptional circumstances, a request can be made for consideration via your line manager. All decisions must be made by a Director.

We will take the following factors into account for any cases we consider.

The legal framework for a decision:

* the individual’s right to work in a particular location
* the employer’s obligation to comply with the relevant country’s employment
  laws, and how complex and costly that is to achieve
* the employer’s obligation to comply with the relevant country’s taxation
  rules, and how complex and costly that is to achieve

Operational challenges we need to be comfortable with:

* management of time zones
* management of a fully remote team member
* client and contractual procurement needs
* the requirements of the role

We would expect individuals to meet any costs (travel, internet, equipment etc)
associated with their working overseas.

dxw will always retain the right to ask you to return to the UK for work with
suitable notice, in line with our employment contract.
