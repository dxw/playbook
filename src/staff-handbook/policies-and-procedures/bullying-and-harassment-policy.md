dxw is committed to providing a work environment that is free from bullying and harassment. We believe that all employees, contractors, and visitors should be treated with dignity and respect. 

This policy sets out the expectations for the behaviour of our employees as well as explaining how we will protect them from bullying and harassment.

Under the Equality Act 2010, harassment is defined as "unwanted conduct related to a relevant protected characteristic, which has the purpose or effect of violating an individual’s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for that individual".

ACAS define bullying as “unwarranted behaviour from a person or group that is either:

* offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting
* an abuse or misuse of power that undermines, humiliates, or causes physical or emotional harm to someone”

This policy applies to all employees and covers all aspects of work including, but not limited to, physical offices, remote workspaces, company events, digital communications and any social activities associated with dxw.

## Types of bullying and harassment

Bullying or harassment may be against one or more people, and may involve single or repeated incidents. 

Bullying and harassment both involve behaviour which harms, intimidates, threatens, undermines, offends or humiliates. 

Bullying is inappropriate behaviour, either direct or indirect, that is not necessarily linked to protected characteristics. 

Under the Equality Act 2010, harassment can be categorised into 3 main types: 

1. harassment related to certain 'protected characteristics'
2. sexual harassment
3. less favourable treatment as a result of harassment

These may present in different ways, for example:

* Physical, including unwanted physical contact
* Verbal, including unwanted comments or jokes, persistent unwarranted criticism, or spreading malicious rumours
* Visual, including displaying offensive material or gestures
* Cyber, including sending abusive, explicit, suggestive or offensive material

## What is dxw's responsibility?

dxw have a duty of care to look after the wellbeing of our employees. We all have a part to play in being aware of, preventing and dealing with bullying or harassment of any kind. 

Below are some of the key steps we take to prevent bullying and harassment from occurring: 

* Policies and training: Ensure that our zero tolerance of harassment and bullying is properly reflected in other policies, induction and training.
* Lead by example: Leaders demonstrate zero tolerance for harassment and bullying through their own behaviour and actions.
* Communicate clearly: Communicate the importance of a bullying and harassment free workplace and the steps being taken to ensure it remains this way.
* Report instances: Any complaints about bullying and harassment will be recorded and investigated with appropriate action taken.

Everyone has a responsibility to ensure they understand this policy and act in accordance with it. Our leaders within dxw are responsible for helping to create an inclusive culture and environment, and ensuring that all complaints raised are dealt with in accordance with this policy.

## Reporting an incident

Any reports of harassment or bullying will be dealt with in line with our [grievance procedure](/staff-handbook/policies-and-procedures/grievance).

Reports of harassment will always be treated confidentially, and any information disclosed will be strictly for the purpose of investigation.

If a complaint of bullying or harassment is upheld and misconduct is found to have taken place, the [disciplinary procedure](/staff-handbook/policies-and-procedures/disciplinary-procedure) will be followed.

Retaliation against someone who raises a concern or participates in an investigation is strictly prohibited and may also lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## Third party incidents

Please raise any incidents of bullying or harassment involving third parties linked to dxw, such as clients, with your line manager or delivery lead. Complaints will be reported to the third party and should be investigated in line with their own policy. dxw will take appropriate measures to support staff members that raise a complaint against a third party. 

## Support

Employees who experience bullying or harassment will be supported by the People team. If you’ve raised a concern, a member of the team will speak with you to discuss the support we can offer you. This may include:

* Counselling services which are available through our employee assistance program
* Time off work
* External support
