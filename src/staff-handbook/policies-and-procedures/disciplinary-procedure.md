Our Disciplinary Procedure ensures that all disciplinary matters are dealt with fairly and consistently. This process outlines the steps that will be followed when concerns of conduct (how you behave at work) are raised. This process applies to all employees of dxw.

During any disciplinary process, care will be taken to ensure that we are impartial, fair and consistent. Any investigations will be undertaken in a timely manner and confidentiality will be maintained.



## Informal procedure

If we feel it’s appropriate, we may discuss a disciplinary issue with you before undertaking any formal action. If we feel that this has resolved the issue we'll confirm everything in writing, following the conversation, including expectations of the change or improvement required. 

If your conduct fails to improve following this conversation, or if the matter is serious enough that an informal procedure is not appropriate, we will follow a formal procedure.

Formal procedure

We will let you know about any concerns relating to your conduct, in writing, at the earliest opportunity.

We will conduct an investigation to establish the facts of the case. Some investigations will be relatively straightforward (e.g. data gathering), others may be more complex and time consuming (e.g. involving interviewing others.) We will let you know roughly how long the investigation is likely to take and keep you updated regularly as it progresses.

The investigation will be completed by your line manager or a more senior manager in the business. You may be asked to attend a meeting as part of the investigation process. You may bring a colleague or a trade union representative to this meeting.

Following this investigation, the person who has been completing the investigation will write to you explaining their findings and confirm if further disciplinary action is required. If further disciplinary action is required we will invite you to a formal disciplinary meeting, otherwise the matter is considered closed.

On rare occasions, we may decide to suspend you from work during the investigation period. During a period of suspension, you will receive your full pay and contractual benefits.

Before any formal disciplinary meeting we will write to you detailing the alleged conduct issue, any relevant evidence from the investigation, and also confirm the potential outcomes, in terms of disciplinary action. This meeting will be chaired by a Director and someone from the People team will also be present. You have the right to be accompanied to this meeting by either a colleague or trade union representative. You will be given at least 7 calendar days notice of the disciplinary meeting.

At the disciplinary meeting, we will discuss with you the concerns over your alleged misconduct and cover any relevant findings from the investigation. Importantly, you will also have the opportunity to explain your case, ask questions and share any special circumstances that may be relevant. 

Following this meeting, we will write to you confirming the outcome of the disciplinary meeting. The outcome will depend on the severity of the issue raised, as well any previous disciplinary action taken against you. 

Potential outcomes include:

* concluding that no misconduct has taken place
* issuing you with a first written warning
* issuing you with a final written written warning
* in cases of gross misconduct, dismiss you without notice

Behaviour amounting to gross misconduct is detailed within clause 16 of your contract of employment.

Any written warnings will explain the:

* nature of the misconduct 
* expectations related to any changes you need to make to your behaviour 
* timeline within which the change needs to be made
* consequences of not making the change (for example, dismissal)

If there are no further conduct concerns within the specified period of any written warning, the warning will expire.

## Appeal procedure

If you feel the disciplinary process has been unfair, disagree with the  outcome, or you have new evidence you wish to be considered, you have the right to appeal against the decision. You must do this in writing to the Head of People within 7 calendar days of receiving confirmation of the disciplinary outcome. 

The Head of People will consider the grounds for your appeal and appoint a Director who has not been involved in your disciplinary process previously, to review your case. You will be invited to attend an appeal meeting where you will have an opportunity to explain your reasons for appeal. Following that meeting we will confirm in writing whether the original disciplinary outcome has been upheld, or your appeal is supported and the original disciplinary outcome is changed.

dxw’s decision following that meeting will be final and there is no further right to appeal.
