## The process

If you do something that we feel constitutes misconduct, or your performance in
your job has been poor, we'll talk to you about it. Hopefully, there's just been
some misunderstanding, or some problem that's easy to solve and won't recur.
Formal action will not be taken without careful investigation of the facts.

If we feel it's appropriate, we may verbally warn you, explaining what has been
unacceptable and what you need to do to improve your conduct or performance.

If your conduct or performance fails to improve following a verbal warning, or
if the matter is serious enough that a verbal warning is not appropriate, we may
hold a disciplinary meeting at which you may be accompanied or represented by a
colleague or trade union official.

Following this meeting, we may:

- conclude that no misconduct has taken place, or that there is no poor
  performance
- issue you with a written warning, which will explain the:

  - nature of the misconduct or poor performance
  - change to your behaviour or performance that you need to make
  - time within which the change needs to be made
  - consequences of not making the change (for example, dismissal)
- in cases of gross misconduct, dismiss you without notice

## Appealing the desicion

If you disagree with the outcome of this hearing, you may appeal against the
decision. You must do this in writing. If you do so, your appeal and the
circumstances of your case will be reviewed by a member of staff who has not
been involved in your case before. That member of staff and the CEO will then
meet to discuss your case, and will either uphold the outcome or schedule
another disciplinary meeting. dxw's decision following that meeting will be
final.
