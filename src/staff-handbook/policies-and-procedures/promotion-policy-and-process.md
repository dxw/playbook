title: Promotion policy and process
last_reviewed_at: ""
---
We want our approach to progression and career development to be transparent,
fair and aligned with [our values](/about-us/our-mission-values-and-principles)
and [Equal Opportunities
Statement](/staff-handbook/policies-and-procedures/inclusion-diversity-equality).
We all have different requirements and aspirations when it comes to learning and
progression. It's important we create an environment that allows everyone to
thrive and fully understand the opportunities available to help them grow.

## Purpose

This policy supports this by outlining the process and parameters which ensure
promotions are considered in a consistent way. It incorporates the following
principles:

* Transparency: Communication relating to the promotion process, including the
required criteria and outcomes, should be clear and visible.
* Fairness: Decision making should be objective and any criteria applied in a
consistent way. Biases should be addressed through focussed education and a
diverse group of decision makers. 
* Sustainability: Promotion decisions should align with our financial position
and business needs.  
* Supportive: Promotions should align with the career and learning goals of our
people, with relevant guidance and constructive feedback provided to everyone.

Within this policy, the word "promotion" means upward movement from one role to
another involving increased responsibility, complexity, and contribution. Other
changes in role, such as lateral moves or a change in specialism, would be
managed separately. For example, through an internal recruitment process or
secondment.

## Eligibility

To be eligible for promotion the applicant must have successfully passed their
probationary period, and not currently be part of a performance improvement plan
or an ongoing disciplinary process. Promotions are always subject to our current
financial position and there being a clear business need for the promoted role.
More senior roles (Principal and above) are not considered under this policy. A
different process would be followed for these roles which more closely aligns to
a full recruitment process.  

## Promotion timelines

Promotion applications will be considered at two points each year, in October
and April. The application window will be open for a minimum of two weeks. Any
successful promotions and associated pay increases will be effective the
following month, from 1st November and 1st May. Any changes to pay will be made
in line with dxw’s pay principles/reward philosophy. There may be some
opportunity for promotion outside these two points (such as an internal
recruitment opportunity), but these would be limited. 

## The process

### Applications

Line managers are responsible for nominating their team members for promotion
using the [promotion application
form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10pXsruenQxIslcngPOeyCh7zaQIJrRHYZCyLEDtZ7fY/edit?tab=t.0).
To reduce bias, managers should consider each team member’s readiness for
promotion and not just the people who are most vocal. When deciding on
“promotion readiness”, the following criteria should be considered:

* **Skills:** Demonstrated proficiency in relevant skills for the new role.
* **Experience:** Relevant experience gained within dxw and/or externally.
* **Performance:** Consistently achieved or exceeded performance expectations in their current role.
* **Values:** Consistent demonstration of our core values.

The extent to which the criteria have been met should be clearly evidenced
through the person's work, achievements and contribution to dxw. Feedback from
others should ideally be gathered and included in the promotion application. Any
additional feedback should also be supported by evidence.

The line manager should confirm that the promotion aligns with the applicant’s
career goals and they are willing to take on the increased responsibility linked
to the promoted role.

The [promotion application
form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10pXsruenQxIslcngPOeyCh7zaQIJrRHYZCyLEDtZ7fY/edit?tab=t.0)
documents the evidence against each criterion and there is a [separate
form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R6VpwemSt6NqhRvffmM2SDnefyTOdbNFx416HwwFS30/edit?tab=t.0)
which outlines the business need/case for the promoted role.

### Decision making

The appropriate “Head of” will be asked if they support the promotion
application (assuming they are not the nominating manager), and the relevant
director has decision making responsibility for the final outcome. To support
consistency and inclusivity, all applications and outcomes will be reviewed by
the Head of People, and approval is also required from the Finance and Resources
Director to ensure financial viability.

### Outcome and feedback

The outcome of the promotion application will either be successful or
unsuccessful. Assuming the applicant meets the eligibility criteria, there will
be two main reasons an application is unsuccessful.

1. **Not financially sustainable:** Although the person may be ready for
   promotion, there is not a current business need for the role and/or it is not
   possible due to current financial constraints. This will be kept under
   review.
2. **Applicant not yet ready:** Based on the information provided against the
   required criteria, the person is not yet ready for a role with increased
   responsibility, even if the role is financially viable.

Clear and constructive feedback will be provided to all applicants outlining the
reasons for the decision, any areas for development and the next steps. This
will be done as quickly as possible, usually within two weeks of the decision
being made.

The decision will be final for that promotion window, however the applicant is
eligible to reapply at the next promotion window. If an applicant or line
manager is unhappy with the decision they can raise it with their “Head of” or
have a confidential conversation with the People team.

### Ongoing support

Line managers are responsible for ensuring their team members have the adequate
support in place to improve on the identified areas of development from their
application feedback or successfully transition into their newly promoted role.
