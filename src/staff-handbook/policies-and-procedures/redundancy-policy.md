We understand that continuity of employment and job security is important for staff wellbeing, and for delivering quality work to our clients. We try to create stability by working hard to keep our sales pipeline healthy and planning our growth carefully so we can hire the right people at the right time.

However, the future is never certain. Significant changes in our plans or in the markets we serve, could mean that we need to make difficult decisions that may include redundancies. If that happens, we will follow a fair and open process.

This section of the Playbook sets out what we’ll do in those circumstances.

## How roles are selected for redundancy

The Directors group is responsible for determining any proposed course of action that involves redundancies. They will often need to work in collaboration with the “Heads of” group and the People team to enable them to make informed decisions.

We will always look for ways to minimise, or avoid, redundancies by seeking to reduce overheads elsewhere in the business. This could include restrictions on recruitment or other non essential spend, a review to see if contractor resources can be reduced or if redeployments can be made to other roles.

Despite this, there may still be times where there is no alternative but to make certain roles redundant. In these circumstances decisions will be informed by data and supported by a valid rationale which will clearly document the problem faced, the options considered, proposed solution, and a plan for implementation.

We might, for example, find that we need to reduce our unbillable roles to keep profits at a sustainable level. Or that we need less people in a particular specialism if we experience a reduction in demand for that type of work. 

Depending on the circumstance, we may use a selection process. This will involve grouping staff in the same or similar roles together in “selection pools'' and using selection criteria to ensure that decisions are objective, measurable and fair.

Any selection criteria would be explained at the time and could include: 

* a performance assessment
* any disciplinary issues having previously arisen
* relevant skills or experience 
* attendance record (which wouldn’t include absences relating to disability, pregnancy or parental leave)

## The process we'll follow if we need to make redundancies

### 1. Inform affected staff

We will organise a meeting to tell you if your role is at risk of redundancy. We will share with you an overview of the rationale and follow up with a letter confirming your role is at risk and explaining the consultation process. 

### 2. Consult staff affected about proposals for change

We will engage in a consultation process with all staff who are placed at risk of redundancy, regardless of their length of service. 

During the consultation process we will:

* outline the changes that are being planned and explain the rationale behind these changes. 
* share information on the criteria being used for redundancy selection, if relevant.
* share any open roles which are currently available in the organisation to ensure any potential redeployment opportunities are fully explored.
* check with each individual how we can best support them throughout the process.

Consultation is also an opportunity for affected staff to ask questions about the changes or process and share any thoughts and ideas on ways in which redundancy can be avoided. It will be a difficult time but we encourage affected staff to be open about any concerns or questions they may have and what support they need.

The length of the consultation period will vary depending on the individual circumstances. In some situations we may need additional time to fully explore any suggestions made before we can reach a final decision. We anticipate that consultation would last at least a week and involve at least two meetings.

Consultation meetings will be held between a Director, and with each person whose role is ‘at risk’.  You can be accompanied by a work colleague or a Trade Union representative and a member of the People team will also be present.

The above process describes an individual consultation. If it was in plan to make more than 20 staff redundant within a 90 day period we would follow “Collective Consultation” Rules which is a different process, involving formal staff representation and a longer consultation process.

### 3. Decision on proposal

Following consultation, we will have a meeting with the affected staff to confirm the final decision on the planned changes.  Full consideration will be given to anything raised through the consultation period before this decision is made. 

Following this meeting we will follow up and confirm the decision in writing. If an affected staff member’s role has been made redundant then the letter will include the terms of the redundancy including notice period, any redundancy pay which is applicable and outline the right to appeal the decision.

### 4. Appeal

The affected staff members have the right to appeal against the decision to make their role redundant. The appeal should be made in writing, clearly outlining the grounds for appeal within seven calendar days of receiving the decision letter. Appeals should be addressed to the Head of People.

## Time off and additional support

Staff who have been given notice of redundancy have the right to take reasonable paid time off to seek other work. This could include registering with a recruitment agency or attending interviews. Arrangements should be made directly with their line manager.

The People team can also help with supporting on updating CVs or preparing for interviews.

## Redundancy pay

In addition to being paid for your notice period, and any accrued but unused holiday pay, dxw will pay statutory redundancy pay.

The amount of statutory redundancy pay is based on your age and length of service. Statutory redundancy pay is not subject to tax. Redundancy pay is tax free up to £30,000, any notice pay and holiday pay will be subject to tax and national insurance deductions. You can find further information on [statutory redundancy pay](https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights/redundancy-pay) on [www.gov.uk](http://www.gov.uk) including a [Statutory Redundancy Pay Calculator](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-redundancy-pay).

## Communication with the wider staff body

We understand that redundancies are a stressful and uncertain time for all staff, especially those who are directly affected. We will always aim to get the balance right of sharing as much as we can, while protecting the privacy of those who are involved in a consultation process. How we communicate, and when, may vary slightly depending on the specific circumstances and taking into account the preferences of the affected staff. We will inform the Staff Council and the Trust Board of any consultation process after the affected employees have been informed. If redundancies are made we will always communicate this to all staff including any relevant rationale.
