The secondary carer is the person who will be on parental leave for a shorter period of time, and will be returning to work first.

The main statutory entitlement for secondary carers is known as paternity leave.

## What dxw offers

dxw will pay you 100% of your normal salary for 5 weeks of parental leave. You may take these consecutively or separately during the first year from birth/adoption. If you want to take more than 5 weeks of leave you can use shared parental leave.

If you are going to become the primary carer for any reason (for example medical incapacity, or bereavement) within the first 18 weeks from the birth or adoption of a child, dxw will consider your eligibility for 100% pay in line with our offer for primary carers. Please speak to the People team to discuss this.

## Eligibility

You are entitled to Paternity Leave from day one of your employment.

To be eligible for enhanced paternity pay, you must have worked for dxw for at least 26 weeks by the qualifying week (15 weeks before the expected week of childbirth) to be eligible.
