For pregnancy, adoption and surrogacy, the primary carer has 10 paid KIT days to take during their parental leave, if they wish to come in for departmental meetings, events or just to spend some time with the team.

Those on shared parental leave can each work up to 20 days while taking SPL. These are called [‘Shared Parental Leave in touch’](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/booking-blocks-of-leave#:~:text=Shared%20Parental%20Leave%20in%20touch,on%20maternity%20or%20adoption%20leave.) (or SPLIT) days. These days are in addition to the 10 ‘keeping in touch’ (or KIT) days available to the primary carer.

This won’t affect your statutory pay and dxw will top this up so you receive a normal day’s pay for each KIT/SPLIT day.
