If you’re having a baby, adopting a child, or having a baby through surrogacy, you may be eligible for Shared Parental Leave and Pay. There are a lot of factors to eligibility, please refer to the [government site](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) to review your particular circumstances.

If you’re eligible and you or your partner ends maternity or adoption leave and pay (or Maternity Allowance) early, then you can:

* take the rest of the 50 weeks of maternity or adoption leave as Shared Parental Leave (SPL)
* take the rest of the 37 weeks of maternity or adoption pay (or Maternity Allowance) as Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP). ShPP is paid at the [current rate per week](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/what-youll-get) or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.

If you’re interested in taking this up, please speak to the People team.
