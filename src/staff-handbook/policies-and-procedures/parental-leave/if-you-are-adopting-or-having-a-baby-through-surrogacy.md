## What dxw offers

If you are the primary carer, you are entitled to take up to 52 weeks of [Adoption Leave](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave). 

dxw will pay 100% of your normal salary for the first 18 weeks of your leave. After this, for the next 21 weeks, you will be paid at the statutory rate for [Adoption Pay](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/pay). Any leave after the first 39 weeks will be unpaid.

## Eligibility

You are entitled to Adoption Leave from day one of your employment.

To be eligible for Adoption Pay, you must have worked for dxw for at least 26 weeks by the week you were matched with a child and give at least 28 days notice of the adoption leave. 

If you are adopting, [proof of adoption](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/how-to-claim) is required to qualify for Statutory Adoption Pay.

If you are having a baby through surrogacy, you must advise us by way of a [statutory declaration](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/how-to-claim).

Only 1 person in a couple can take [statutory adoption leave](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/leave). The other person could get secondary carer leave and pay instead.

If you are taking adoption leave, you are entitled to paid time off work to attend 5 adoption appointments after you’ve been matched with a child.
