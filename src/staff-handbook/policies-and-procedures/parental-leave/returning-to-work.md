Returning to work is a personal decision and the earliest you can return to work legally after giving birth is 2 weeks. The People team will discuss your leave dates with you prior to you going on leave. You are free to change your mind while on parental leave, however we ask for 8 weeks notice of an intended change to your return date.

You may wish to consider a phased return when you do come back and this can also be discussed with the People team and your line manager. If for some reason you decide not to return to work, we do not expect you to pay back any of your parental leave.
