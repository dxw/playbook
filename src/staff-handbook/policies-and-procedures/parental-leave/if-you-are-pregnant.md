A person giving birth must take at least the first 2 weeks after the birth as parental leave.

When you know you are pregnant, please tell us as soon as you are comfortable. We can restrict this knowledge to your Director, Line Manager and the People team. This will allow us to check that your working arrangements are safe, help you manage any pregnancy related sickness, and make sure you are paid for any [antenatal care appointments](https://www.gov.uk/working-when-pregnant-your-rights). 

Legally, you don’t have to make us aware until after 15 weeks before your due date. 

We will require a MATB1 certificate ahead of your parental leave and you will receive this from your midwife.

## What dxw offers

If you are the primary carer, you are entitled to take up to 52 weeks of [Maternity Leave](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave). 

dxw will pay 100% of your normal salary for the first 18 weeks of your leave. After this, for the next 21 weeks, you will be paid at the statutory rate for either [Maternity Pay](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/pay), or [Maternity Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-allowance) depending on your eligibility. Any leave after the first 39 weeks will be unpaid.

## Eligibility

You are entitled to Maternity Leave from day one of your employment.

To be eligible for enhanced maternity pay, you must have worked for dxw for at least 26 weeks by the qualifying week (15 weeks before the expected week of childbirth).
