Content design means giving the user the information they need, not the information we think they should have. The content team at dxw works across the organisation to make sure that content – from buttons to blog posts – helps users get what they need.

We do this by:

* getting involved in user research as early as possible so we understand what users need and how they talk and think about the service
* reviewing and auditing existing content and recommending how to improve it
* talking to subject matter experts to improve our understanding of the context, policies and issues that affect the project
* looking at how users search for and find the information they need
testing how best to organise and structure content in a way that makes sense to users
* writing, reviewing and editing the content the user sees
iterating content based on user behaviour, feedback and interactions

## Why the content team’s work is important

We create content that helps dxw deliver usable, accessible, helpful services.We make sure that we provide the right information and ask the right questions to help users do what they need to.

We think about how people interact with services and what can make those interactions difficult. Things like how much time a user has, what emotional state they’re in, whether they’re using assistive technology, how comfortable they are with English and how words might affect or exclude them.

On projects, we work with clients to translate their specialist knowledge into information that helps users get what they need from services quickly and easily.

The work we do helps dxw create public services that work well for everyone who depends on them.

## How the content team works with the wider dxw team

We work with the wider team at all stages of projects. You’ll find us:

* reviewing existing evidence, analytics, feedback and data to learn more about user needs and pain points
* helping researchers draft discussion guides, take notes and analyse data
working with subject matter experts to make sure both business needs and user needs are met with helpful, accurate content
* helping service designers understand the role content plays in user journeys
* using content to improve user flows and design prototypes
* helping developers create error messages
* working with the developers and designers to make sure everything is usable and accessible
* helping teams figure out what information we need to capture, where it comes from and how we label and store it
* working with colleagues to share dxw’s work in blog posts, design histories and show and tells
