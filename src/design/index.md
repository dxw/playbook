## Design team principles

Designers at dxw follow these principles:

1. **Democratise the design process**

   Take into account, and value highly, the input of others in the design
   process. While we are ultimately responsible for design in a delivery team,
   we don’t work in isolation.

2. **Value clarity in everything we do**

   Use plain language in interfaces, writing and conversation.

3. **Overlap with other disciplines**

   Work closely with people that have different skills to you, in the knowledge
   that different perspectives make our decisions stronger and elevate our work.

4. **Communicate constantly**

   Never go missing. Our teammates always understand what we’re doing and why,
   because we’re all aiming for the same outcome.

5. **Know we are not the user**

   Do not assume to know how users of our services think or act. We acknowledge
   that things such as genetics, upbringing, religious and geographical culture,
   and past experiences make us all different. We work closely with our user
   researchers to gain understanding and insight about the people that use the
   things we design. _“One accurate measurement is worth more than a thousand
   expert opinions.”_ ~ Grace Hopper

6. **Be educators**

   Know that being open about our work, and helping others to understand our
   decisions and why we make them, benefits everybody.

7. **Be kind**

   Be tolerant, understanding, empathetic and compassionate. Look for
   opportunities to help and care for others. Putting people at the centre of
   everything will help you be a better designer.

8. **Embrace questions**

   Understand that when people ask questions and give feedback it is to make
   something better. If we can not articulate our decisions then we may not have
   made the best choice.

9. **Ask questions**

   Always ask questions and seek the truth; when we understand the problem we
   can solve it. When things seem muddy take a step back and try and find the
   original intent or gaps in understanding. _“If I had an hour to solve a
   problem I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes
   thinking about solutions.”_ ~ Albert Einstein

10. **Always assume the best intent**

    We are passionate about what we do, but we are a team. When you have
    difficult conversations or feedback we should always assume that it is
    coming from a good place.

11. **Tell stories**

    When we talk about our work and why we do what we do, do not just state the
    facts. Inject some humanity into it; turn it into a story with a beginning,
    a middle, and an end.
