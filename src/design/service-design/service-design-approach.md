This is an outline of how we approach Service Design at dxw. Service Design can
cross over a number of disciplines, so we've written this based on our
experience of applying service design to projects at dxw.

## 1. Clarify the problem and set the direction

* As part of the project kickoff, service designers interrogate the brief set by
  the client. Following an inception workshop, we might facilitate a **problem
  framing** session to identify the intended outcomes of the work (though not
  their expected solutions), alongside the recognised needs and problems that
  have initiated the project. This session happens early in the inception phase
  so that the outcomes can inform the project roadmap. We may use this
  [problem framing template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ygq9oF97XI5VebbchAP422oLo6SigkK_Ts__0TaS0-Y/edit?usp=sharing)
  to help structure the discussion with stakeholders.
* Problem framing results in a clear and careful articulation of the problem and
  the **measurable impact** that will result from the project. Arriving at this
  statement together with the client helps the project team **align on a clear
  scope**, and serves as a guide throughout the decision-making stages of the
  design process.
* We work with user researchers to **develop a project plan** outlining the
  activities and methods that are appropriate to the project. At this stage, we
  can **select and adjust the activities** which will best meet the project’s
  budget, time and people constraints, as well as any other nuances. We may play
  with non-standard approaches and tools such as provocations and mental models,
  particularly when creating a new service that doesn’t yet exist.

## 2. Explore the service landscape and visualise insights

* Service designers work closely with user researchers to **conduct research**
  with users, stakeholders and internal teams and **synthesise insights**.
  Throughout research we aim to understand the people, processes, data and
  technologies that make up the service landscape and help the team to see the
  “bigger picture”.
* We also **look outwards**, considering social, environmental and economic
  factors, policy, technology and behavioural trends and other existing data.
  This helps **build a richer picture** of the ecosystem that the service will
  inhabit.
* We take a **systems thinking** approach in all that we do. This means viewing
  the service landscape as a system of interconnected components (both ‘hard’
  and ‘soft’) and considering **relationships and feedback loops** between them.
  It also means we seek to understand system **dynamics** and how things may
  change over time. In this way we think about problems in both the **short and
  long term**, considering opportunities for change in both timeframes.
* When we **visualise the insights** gathered throughout the exploration, it
  helps us to think through the problem at different **levels of zoom**, moving
  between the abstract and concrete. We keep a holistic view by **mapping the
  service**, particularly the ecosystem, stakeholders and current state. But we
  also dig deep into the details and visually capture the more technical aspects
  such as the behaviours, data, systems and processes involved.
* This process **highlights opportunities** to improve service experiences and
  helps us to communicate them to others.

## 3. Create a service strategy

* Service designers aim to **preserve clarity in the scope** throughout the
  process and evolve the problem statement that was created at the beginning of
  the project. For example, early in a discovery it may not be clear what the
  service can achieve, so the problem statement may be adjusted as decisions are
  made and limitations become clearer.
* Service designers think about the strategy of the service, and how it will
  meet both the user and the organisation or business goals. We can help service
  teams to develop business models and value proposition statements that are
  clear, measurable and demonstrate benefits to both the end-user and
  organisation.

## 4. Imagine new service experiences

* Service designers help the team transition **from research insights to service
  concepts**. We plan and facilitate workshops and other design activities.
  There are a number of methods that we may use at this stage, but all of them
  link concepts directly to value creation for both the user and the
  organisation.
* **Co-design** is the gold-standard method to use during this exploratory
  phase. We bring together stakeholders, subject matter experts, designers and
  where possible end users to generate and discuss design ideas.
* As part of ideation sessions, service designers can facilitate the
  **prioritisation of concepts** to prototype the best concepts (or blends of
  concepts). We use tools such as heuristic reviews or the theory of change to
  reflect on whether the proposed solution meets the needs and initial
  intentions of the service.
* We help multi-disciplinary teams to reach the best outcomes by ensuring
  insights and ideas are shared effectively and that different **workstreams are
  aligned**. We facilitate **collaborative decision-making** and help teams and
  wider stakeholders reach **consensus** on the way forward.

## 5. Prototype the service

* Before any prototyping begins, service designers test the proposition with
  customers to understand if it will offer value to the end-users/customers as
  well as the business.
* Service designers **prototype and test service elements** that fall outside of
  a screen context, for example experiential prototypes of a physical space.
* Service designers consider wider factors relevant to service success such as
  marketing, communications, business process change and behavioural change. We
  work with relevant teams and specialists to design and prototype these
  elements of the service where possible.
* A service designer may support the creation of screens and user flows, or
  would ideally support an interaction designer in doing this. We work to ensure
  that interaction designers, content designers and developers have clear user
  stories to work from, and that these are grounded in research insight. We also
  help define a prototyping strategy.

## 6. Tell the story and plan for implementation

* As we move from abstract to concrete, we craft artefacts that help others to
  **envision the proposed service**. We blend visual storytelling (e.g.
  storyboarding), which develops empathy for the people using and delivering the
  service, with technical diagrams (e.g. service blueprints), which serve as a
  detailed guide towards the implementation of the experience.
* Service design helps to **build a narrative** of the service. Reflecting on
  the initial problem statement, a service designer can create a compelling
  presentation that explains how the problems identified at the start of the
  project have the potential to be resolved through the proposed service,
  explaining the rationale for the design decisions along the way.
* Service designers consider factors that contribute to the service’s **future
  success**. We can create guides to support its implementation, prepare
  training that staff may need in order to deliver the service, and recommend
  organisational structures to ensure it will be properly managed in the future.
* We also consider factors that could limit the success of the service and help
  teams mitigate them through **risk management**.
* Services never exist in a vacuum, and their success depends on good alignment
  with the technology and processes that surround them. Service designers help
  manage these **technical and non-technical interfaces**.

## 7. Beta, live and beyond…

* Service designers like to be involved throughout the beta and live phases of a
  new service to help ensure that **performance is tracked and outcomes
  measured**. We help service teams set up Key Performance Indicators and the
  data streams required to track them.
* In a similar way we can also **support teams running existing services** to
  identify and implement improvements.
* When those services require transformation of an existing service the service
  designer plays an important role helping to **define channel shift
  strategies** for transitioning to a digital service.
