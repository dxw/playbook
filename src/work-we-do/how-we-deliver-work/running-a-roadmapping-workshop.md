For an alpha or beta, or for a significant update to a live service, we run an
initial roadmapping workshop during inception.

The aim of the workshop is to get everyone on the same page about the goals,
activities, risks and dependencies of the project.

Our roadmapping workshops are developed from the
[Seven questions to build a roadmap](https://www.jamiearnold.com/blog/2014/07/22/seven-questions-to-build-a-roadmap)
described by Jamie Arnold.

For a discovery, we run a
[discovery kick-off workshop](/work-we-do/how-we-deliver-work/running-a-discovery-kick-off-workshop/).

## Why we have a roadmap

A roadmap is a strategy tool. It sets out the direction for a product or service
and outlines how we’ll achieve our objectives.

Roadmaps should:

* Set clear, agreed goals
* Be related to outcomes, rather than specific outputs and dates or releases
* Be adaptable and respond to change
* Cover the complete service we are providing, not just the digital parts we are
  building

We create roadmaps in workshops where we aim to:

* Understand and make sure we have agreement on the goals of the project
* Figure out what we need to have to be successful (capabilities), and how that
  relates to the goals and desired outcomes
* Identify risks and dependencies
* Understand the stakeholder landscape
* Set priorities, particularly for the things we need to do first

Before the workshop you need to have clear high level goals for the work, and
the commitment of key stakeholders to attend. If you don’t have those, focus on
understanding and resolving those issues first

After the workshop, the roadmap becomes a living part of the project
documentation. But we recognise that the conversations that come from building
the roadmap are just as, if not more, important than the document itself.

## Questions for roadmapping

**About the project**

1. What are our goals and outcomes?

   What are the overall goals for the project and service?

   What intermediate outcomes do we want to achieve? How might we measure them?

   What standards and codes must we meet, for service, accessibility, equality,
   technology?
2. What are we assuming?

   What ideas and beliefs are our goals and outcomes based on? How confident are
   we that they are true? That they won’t change?

   What biases and gaps in understanding might we have? What unintended
   consequences might there be?
3. What are we trying to learn or prove?

   What do we need to know to make good decisions? What might the organisation
   already know?

   What risky assumptions should we be testing? What will we need to prove to
   validate our work?

**About the service**

1. Who are the users?

   Are they members of the public, professionals or staff? Are they current or
   potential users?

   What different groups, job roles, circumstances, environments, access needs
   and support needs might be important? Who might currently be worst served and
   most likely to experience barriers?

   How will we engage and involve the different people we need to work with?
2. What are we operating?

   What digital and physical components will the service be made up of? What
   people will be involved in operating the service?

   What digital and offline channels and support routes might there be? Which
   channels might different groups need and use?

   How will we roll out the service to all the people who might need to use it?
3. What capabilities do we need?

   What capabilities will we need to build and operate the service?

   What do we already have? What is new? What is well understood and what is
   novel?

**About the context**

1. Who are our stakeholders?

   Are they colleagues from our organisation or other public sector bodies? What
   community, civil society, professional and advocacy groups might be
   important?

   What is their relationship to the work? What expectations and concerns might
   they have? How closely might they be involved? How might they help?
2. What are our dependencies?

   What other work or organisations will the project and service depend on? What
   other work might be an enabler or blocker for us?

   Who is depending on us?

   How will we manage those dependencies?
3. What do we need to communicate?

   What meetings, governance and other processes do we need to feed into?

   What communications might we expect to create? Why and for who?

   How will we share information? How will we make our communications accessible
   and inclusive?

## Using Now, Next and Later to prioritise

By default, we prioritise the roadmap into:

* **Now**, the first outcomes we’ll work towards and all the things we’ll need
  to do for those
* **Next**, the outcomes we’ll work on once we’ve completed the first things
* **Later**, everything else

To help ground the discussion, you can give a timeframe to the Now and Next.
This might be quarters for a bigger piece of work, or single sprints for a
smaller project.

We recommend prioritising as you ask each question, rather than waiting until
the end. This will involve some iteration as the answers to later questions
influence previous thoughts about priorities.

Be careful not to always prioritise the largest groups and most common needs.
Consider prioritising people who are currently worst served and who experience
the most barriers.

And be careful not to leave work on accessibility and inclusion until Later. You
can and should be working on these from your first sprint.

You might not have time to prioritise everything. But the conversations about
priority should help set the direction and scope of your first sprint.

## Planning the workshop

From our experience, roadmapping workshops take from 2 hours to a full day.
Follow [good workshop practice](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/principles)
to help everyone contribute, make the best use of their valuable time and
produce a good result.

If a service is particularly large and complicated, it’s better to build a high
level roadmap that you can refine later, rather than trying to run a longer and
larger workshop.

The product owner and delivery or transformation lead normally lead the
workshop. And you should aim to have a broad set of participants to represent
the views of both the delivery team and the wider client organisation.

From the client organisation, aim to include people from service and product
management, policy, operations, and technology, along with specific subject
matter experts.

From the team you might also include a designer, researcher, developer and
technical architect.

## Building the roadmap

Before the workshop:

* Create a grid with a row for each question, and columns for Now, Next and
  Later. This can be on a wall, or in an online tool like
  [Miro](https://miro.com/).

During the workshop:

* Start with the goals. Work to make them clear, then break them down into more
  specific outcomes with potential measures Work through the rest of the
  questions, one by one
* For each question, ask participants to write items on paper or digital sticky
  notes
* Ask participants to talk about their items, to clarify and improve any unclear
  items, and to make sure you include everyone’s thoughts
* Group or stack similar items
* Discuss priorities as you go. Place the items in the Now, Next and Later
  columns

## Using the roadmap

Turn the outputs from the workshop into a roadmap document. It can live on a
wall, in a tool like Miro, or both. We usually arrange the content of the
roadmap into swimlanes. These can be:

* The roadmapping questions
* Common themes or workstreams within the project
* Specific goals or outcomes

Use the roadmap to start conversations with stakeholders about activities and
priorities, and to gain consensus across teams and organisations.

Someone must own and maintain the roadmap. Most often this will be a Product
Manager or Product Owner in the client organisation, although we will own the
roadmap if we have to. The owner works with the team and stakeholders to
regularly review and update the roadmap. Without clear ownership the roadmap
will quickly drop out of use and lose its value.
