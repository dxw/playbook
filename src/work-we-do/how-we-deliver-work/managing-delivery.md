## Managing delivery

> "The delivery manager sets the team up for successful delivery. They remove
> obstacles, or blockers to progress, constantly helping the team become more
> self organising. They enable the work a team does rather than impose how itâ€™s
> done."
> --<cite>[Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/delivery-manager)</cite>

At dxw, delivery leads ensure that sprints go smoothly and that the team remain
productive. They are generally the client's first and main point of contact, and
are responsible for ensuring that we deliver good work.

Throughout a sprint, delivery leads ensure that an agreed process is followed,
organising and facilitating discussions as required. They run sprint planning
and retrospective sessions. They run daily standups with the dxw and client
teams to keep everyone informed and to discuss and resolve any blockers.

Outside of these sessions and standups, they maintain regular communication with
the client and the delivery team to respond quickly to challenges as they arise.
If priorities change during a sprint, the delivery lead works with the client to
understand and plan for the impact of the change.
