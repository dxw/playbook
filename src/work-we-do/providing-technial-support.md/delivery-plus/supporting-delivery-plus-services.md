The technology team supports some of our client services. We split our support
into two units: [GovPress](/govpress-unit/support/) and Delivery Plus.

## Support helpdesk

For both units we use [Zendesk](https://dxw.zendesk.com) to manage support
requests. All incidents and requests for us to fix a problem or make a change to
a site we support come to us via Zendesk as a ticket. We use tickets to manage
requests in order to:

- keep track of all the things we need to do and what state they're in, for us
  and our clients
- have a record of the changes we're asked to make
- ensure that we only accept change requests from people who are authorised

If a client asks us to do something via any other channel, we ask them to email
the request to support@dxw.com, which opens a ticket in Zendesk, or open a
ticket directly.

It's important that we do not do any work on a client website or service unless
we are working during scheduled development time or on a relevant ticket.

### Support rota

We work on tickets by having a developer from the delivery team and another
developer from the GovPress team on support according to a rota, supported by an
operations engineer.

Delivery team developers are assigned to support for one week at a time and work
on tickets for the whole week. They are responsible for the non-GovPress support
requests.

If you're on support, take a look at the
[guide on how we handle support](/tech/support-and-on-call/).

## Support principles

### Be responsive

Clients expect us to deal with their issues promptly. But they understand that
this isn't always possible. They are generally forgiving of the fact that we're
sometimes busy, and they understand that some issues are complex and require
long investigations.

The thing most clients value above all else is being kept informed of what is
going on. The first quality of a good ticket experience is responsiveness. We
keep clients informed of what we're doing, even if there hasn't been much
progress.

### Stick to your commitments

It's important that we do what we say we'll do, and don't promise things we
can't deliver. If we're unable to deal with a ticket in good time and leave an
update saying we'll work on it tomorrow, we must meet that commitment.

It is doubly bad to fail to meet a commitment and not say anything about it.
Responsiveness is always the priority. So if for some reason we couldn't do what
we said we'd do, we always respond to say so.

### Make a good impression

In tickets as in all things, we are mindful of dxw's
[values](/about-us/our-mission-values-and-principles/#our-values).

Many clients' only routine contact with us is via support tickets, so it's vital
that their experience of the support system is a good one, and that they have a
positive experience with us personally.

In general:

- we are personable, friendly, and helpful
- if things look like they're going to get difficult or the client seems
  unhappy, we are honest and assume good faith
- if we make a mistake, we take responsibility and apologise, and if the client
  seems very upset, we let the account manager know
- if we do become annoyed or frustrated by a ticket, we come back to it later

### Don't over-deliver

Of course, every client would like us to go the extra mile to solve their
problem. But they also understand that to do that for them would mean bad
service for another client - or that we never get to their issue, because we're
too busy gold-plating the solution to someone else's.

While we do everything we can to make sure the client is happy with our
solution, we are also mindful of what's practical. We don't do extensive
development work on tickets, or trial new approaches. We don't play with new
tools or sink hours into interesting bugs. We set those things aside, and
schedule time to do them later.

The main purpose of a ticket is to take some action that solves the problem, as
quickly as possible. Generally speaking, we do the most time-efficient thing
that we can. Of several potential, acceptable solutions that solve the problem,
we do the one which can be implemented the most quickly.
