## Who we are

The web has revolutionised the way society works. Most of society has reaped the
benefits of digital technology, but most public services lag behind. As a
result, they are often expensive to build and run, and hard for people to use.

Since dxw was founded in 2008, a lot of things have become better. The
Government Digital Service has changed the conversation about how and why
services get built, and many are much better as a result. But the challenge
facing the public sector is not one that any organisation could tackle alone.

In addition to talented in-house teams who understand how to deliver great
services, the public sector needs talented suppliers who understand how to work
with it. And who are driven by a desire to make public services better. And who
understand how to combine a modern technological approach with agile principles
of development and user-centricity. That's what dxw is here to do.

We build digital public services that are flexible, efficient, effective and
useful. We want people's experience of those services to be straightforward,
positive and seamless. We believe that in building those services using agile
principles, we can help government to embed those same principles in other parts
of their organisations.

Ultimately, we want to help the public sector to spend less on technology so
that it can spend more on education, healthcare, policing and welfare. We
believe that it is possible to use technology and agile principles to help
government become something recognisably, radically better: and we want to help
make it happen.

dxw helps public sector teams to make good technology decisions and build better
services.

### Our values

We think that it's very important to have a talented team if we're going to
succeed. But just as important as raw talent is our ability to work well
together. These are the values that we aspire to, and help each other to
achieve.

#### Helpful

We are helpful, useful and expert. We give practical and pragmatic advice to
each other, and to our clients.

#### Positive

We are positive, cheerful and supportive. Even in crisis, we stay optimistic. We
[assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith)
and offer constructive challenge.

#### Reliable

We are reliable, consistent and committed. We make every effort to live up to
each others' expectations, and to exceed the expectations of our clients.

#### Honest

We are honest, trustworthy and straightforward. We give plain-spoken, frank,
accurate feedback and advice, and we never mislead or obscure the issue at hand.

#### Curious

We are curious, diverse and creative. We help each other to learn and improve
and we're sensitive to each others' needs. We love technology and finding new
ways to solve problems.

#### Determined

We are determined, discerning and motivated. We believe in high standards, we
enjoy doing things properly, and we're loath to settle for less.

### Our principles

These principles help us live up to our [values](#our-values), and guide our
behaviour and decision making in all the things we do at dxw.

#### Keep an agile mindset

At dxw, we think that agile is a mindset that’s accepting of change, curious
about trying new approaches to make things better, and values careful planning
in short chunks.

We think that the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) contains a lot
of wisdom, but we don’t follow the industry of methodologies, training and
certifications that has grown up around it. We think agile is something you
learn to be, not something that you learn to do.

We recognise the importance of compliance and governance, so we build those
activities into each step.

#### Work at a sustainable pace

At dxw, we work at a sustainable pace. We estimate work and schedule it
conservatively, and set realistic expectations with clients about the pace of
delivery.

This doesn't mean that we don't work hard. Being productive is a vital part of
maintaining the trust that our clients give us, and it’s important not to let
them down.

#### Balance openness and confidentiality

dxw believes it's best to be open about what we're doing. We encourage our
clients to do the same, as does the
[service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). We talk, blog and write
about what we're doing, and we are open about as much as we can.

At dxw, we release [code](https://www.github.com/dxw), publish our
[contracts](https://www.github.com/dxw/contracts) and things like this playbook
and talk with people about what we're up to because we believe that we'll
ultimately have more opportunities to work, grow and improve than if we kept
everything to ourselves.

However, there are some things that we must keep private.

- Our clients trust us to host content that is not public, like upcoming
  announcements and discussions made as part of formulating new policy. This is
  not our information to be open about, and it's very important to keep it
  confidential.
- We also hold some personal data about and/or on behalf of our clients. We
  never share any of this data, including contact details. See also:
  [data protection](#data-protection).
- We are sometimes sent documents that are
  [protectively marked](#protective-marking-scheme), and we have a scheme of our
  own. Information in these documents is confidential.
- Information about work that is currently being procured (whether we are
  bidding or not) and any other information that could damage the commercial
  interests of a client or supplier

#### Diversity and inclusion statement

At dxw, we value people and want them to feel free to be themselves.

We embrace each other's differences, in gender, religion, beliefs, ethnicity,
disability, age, sexual orientation, neurotype, nationality, and identity. We
are diverse - like the people we build, design, and create for.

Amazing things happen when we collaborate together. We work in the open and
believe everyone's voices should be heard.

We recognise individual needs and aim to provide a work environment that is
accessible, welcoming, and empowering for all. We want everyone to feel
supported and included in our wider community.

Our [values](#values) are more than just words on a page - it’s about constant
action and holding ourselves to account.

We’re committed to being transparent with our diversity information and
regularly assessing the impact of all our policies and practices.

Thank you for being you - it makes us better.

### Advisory Council

dxw does not have external investors or shareholders. To help keep us honest, we
are very lucky to have a voluntary advisory council, made up of a small group of
senior figures, who meet quarterly to discuss and provide guidance on our
strategy, business plan and other topics related to company health and
progression. The group have a wealth of experience of public and private sector
work, as well as being friends of dxw that share our values.

### This Playbook

This Playbook is our reference for who we are and the way we do things.
Something canonical that tells us what the current “right way” to do things is.

If you’re a current or potential client, this Playbook is also for you. To help
you understand us and how we can work together.

We continually update the principles and guides in our Playbook. Because we’re
always exploring better ways to get things done. What’s written here is the way
we do things now. Until we find something better, and write that down.

This Playbook was originally inspired by
[Thoughtbot's excellent playbook](https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/). Thanks,
Thoughtbot!

#### Updating the Playbook

This Playbook is a collaborative effort. Anyone at dxw can and should edit it.
So if you spot something that's wrong, feel free to hop in and correct it.

But remember that this Playbook is the result of our conversations about how we
should do things, not a substitute for one. So don't make changes unless they
reflect our shared agreement about how things are going to be done.

This document is also public, because there is very little about our process
that cannot be open. But there will be some things that should be private. So
don't forget that changes here get published to the world.

To update the Playbook, follow the
[guide to Contributing to the Playbook](https://playbook.dxw.com/#/contributing)
and the [dxw style guide](https://playbook.dxw.com/#/guides/style-guide).
