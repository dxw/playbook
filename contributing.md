# Contributing to the Playbook

## What you will need
1. A GitHub account
2. To be invited to the [dxw organisation](https://github.com/dxw)
3. To be invited to the [staff team](https://github.com/orgs/dxw/teams/staff)

## Why GitHub?
We are all encouraged to help shape dxw and help it grow. The decisions we make are represented in the playbook so it's important to have an open and collaborative means to evolve it.

GitHub allows us to:
1. Present our ideas against those existing
2. Discuss other people's ideas
3. Find agreement and get things [changed](http://playbook.dxw.com/)
4. Store a history of our decision making

## Decide if new content is for the playbook

### It’s in the playbook if
* it’s a principle explained in plain english.
* it’s something we want to/are comfortable to share outside of dxw.
* we want it to be visible to the wider team.
* it's user research or design glossary.

### It’s in guides if
* it’s a detailed, step by step instruction.
* we’re talking about something specialist. This could mean we are using jargon. and referring to community-known methods and ways of working.

### It’s something else if
* it’s something visual and reusable, it will likely belong in the brandbook. 
* it’s a good, work-related read, there may be a repository to put it in.
* it’s a poster it should be succinct, large-print friendly and something we want to share with the wider dxw team. It’s also something we want clients to see and understand. It belongs in the brandbook.
