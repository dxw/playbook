## What are weeknotes?

We use weeknotes to inform the people we’re working with about our progress,
issues we’re dealing with, and what we’re planning to do. They can be a really
useful way to update people you deal with directly, but they can also be shared
more widely with people who are less directly involved in a day to day basis.

## What makes a good weeknote?

A good weeknote:

* Sounds like it was written by a human. Ask yourself whether it would be
  something you’d be happy to receive and read. You don’t need to make it too
  formal.
* Is honest about progress as well as issues. This is a good way to flag things
  that need to get dealt with on a project.
* Gives a sense of what the team is delivering as whole. Don’t just write
  bullets covering what every individual on the team did that week.
* Brings the project to life. Do you have any images you can use to illustrate
  what you’ve been doing?
* Is frequent and regular. This is a good way to build trust with the wider
  team.

## Template

**Weeknotes:** *project name* **Week ending:** *date*

*We send out weeknotes to update you on progress. Weeknotes highlight things
we’re worried about, acknowledge achievements and show progress, and layout what
we plan to do next. Along with our show and tells, this is the main way you will
find out about the project so please read.*

*Get in touch with \[insert delivery manager name] with any questions or
feedback.*

### **Good Things**

*What are the main highlights this week?* *Have you hit any milestones, or
overcome any significant blockers?* *What decisions have been made?* *Do you
have any images to show progress? (e.g. a photo from a workshop, or a screenshot
of something that’s been built?)*

### **Learned things**

*Have the team learned anything from a retro?* *Did anything happen that you
didn’t expect?* *Have the team made any changes to how the team operates?* *Have
the team uncovered anything new from user research?* *Does anyone from the team
have any personal reflections that they’d like to share?*

### **Difficulties**

*What challenges or issues does the wider project team need to be aware of?*
*How are you dealing with them?* *What help do you need - either from within the
project team or elsewhere?*

### **Achievements**

*Are there any team achievements that need recognising?* *Are there any
individuals you want to recognise? (they don’t need to be inside the core
project team - they could be someone from a different department who helped you
out this week).*

### **What’s next**

*What are you planning to deliver in the next sprint?* *When is the next show
and tell?* *What key meetings are coming up?*
