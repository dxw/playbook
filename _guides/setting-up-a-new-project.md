title: Setting up a new project
---
At dxw we frequently start new projects and work with clients we haven’t worked
with before. Delivery leads at dxw are responsible for setting up projects and
ensuring all the right things are in place for when the team starts work.

We often find that time is limited and transitioning between projects can be a
challenge, for delivery leads and the wider team.

This guide provides advice and tips, as well as a checklist for delivery leads
about to start a new project. It can work for large projects (a phase of work
like a discovery or a beta) as well as smaller projects which might only be a
few weeks long.

## Before a project starts

In most cases, there’s not a very long lead time between winning a piece of work
and starting it. We sometimes have a number of days, rather than weeks, for the
team to get everything in place. This includes things like contracts, scheduling
a team to do the work and making a plan for the first few days.

We’re lucky if the same delivery lead has been involved in the sales work that
led to the project being won, because there’s always other work in flight. It’s
important that knowledge is shared and the necessary introductions made so we
can get the work off to a good start.

It is however worth remembering that most of our sales proposals are produced
with limited information about the project, and it’s only once we start that we
get a better idea of what the work is and what skills we’ll need to do it.

There are several things that delivery leads should do first, regardless of the
shape of the project:

### Do some reading

Get hold of any background materials, such as proposal documents, meeting notes,
project documents or email chains. Familiarise yourself with the brief and
conversations that have taken place so far.

### Speak to the person who has had the most involvement in the work to date

Find out who led the sales bid, or who has the most knowledge about the project
at dxw. This should give you a fairly good understanding of what the project is,
what work has been done so far and what dxw is expected to deliver. Find out
who’s who in the client organisation, and ask for an introduction to the main
point of contact.

### Meet the client team

At the earliest opportunity, arrange a meeting with the client. It might be one
person at this stage or everyone that will be involved in the project. Use the
time to build rapport and get to know each other, as well as agree a start date
and schedule any important meetings that need to be held in the first few weeks.
If you can, bring along other team members as it might be useful to have their
input.

### Ask lots of questions

Whether you’re talking to the person who led the sales bid, or the client team,
ask questions.

* What is the brief? What outputs or outcomes are we expected to deliver?
* Who is the service manager or product owner in the client team?
* Who are the important stakeholders we need to be aware of?
* Who from the client team will be working full-time on the project?
* Are there any deadlines, dependencies or risks that the team need to be aware
  of?
* What skills and capabilities do the client team have? Are they used to working
  in agile teams? Have they delivered a digital service before? Are they
  familiar with user research?

## Setting up the project

Before the project starts there’s also a number of tasks, mostly administrative
ones, that need to be done. Below is a checklist of things that need to be in
place for a typical project.

* Send out calendar invitations for regular ceremonies:

  * Standups - daily, 10-15 minutes between 10:00-11:00.
  * Sprint planning meetings - fortnightly, for anything between 1-3 hours,
    usually on the first day of a sprint (a Wednesday).
  * Retrospectives - fortnightly, usually held at the end of a sprint or before
    planning.
  * Show and tells - fortnightly, at the end of a sprint for most projects. The
    client can help you identify a suitable time and place (we recommend keeping
    it to a regular time to maximise attendance).
* Create a Slack channel and add dxw and client team members. Clients and
  contractors should be set up as single-channel guests.
* Create a Trello board for the project. Use the standard dxw columns or make up
  your own, depending on the needs of the project and how the team want to work.
* Create a Google Drive folder, under ‘Client work’ for the project. Use this to
  store any documents, files, week notes and anything else that the team might
  need access to. Make sure everyone in the team knows where to find it, and
  give clients and contractors access to individual documents or sub-folders as
  required.
* Set up a video-call for standups so that anyone working remotely or from
  another location can join. We like to use appear.in and talky.io.
* Create a week notes document, using the template.
* Organise a kick-off meeting with the client, either a few days before the
  first sprint or on the first day. The whole team should attend this.
* Check that commercial tasks have been done. It’s worth checking there’s a
  signed order summary (this should be shared with you ahead of time) and this
  matches the schedule in 10,000ft. Check invoices have been created in Xero and
  you know where to find them. Also check 10,000ft early so you’re aware of any
  upcoming holiday being taken by the team.
* Create a spreadsheet to track days worked against the order summary. This will
  show you how money is being spent against the forecasted budget, and help you
  in any conversations with the client about team changes, extending the project
  or issues with budget.

## Kick off meeting

While the project is being set up, and before it starts, a kick off should
happen. This ensures:

* The team get introduced to each other & discuss and agree how they want to
  work
* The team and client know and understand what the work is all about
* We realise our priorities so we have an initial plan
* We discuss ways of working

You should have everyone working on the project in this meeting (even if they’re
part-time).

### Introductions

Use the kick-off to introduce everyone to each other. It might be a good idea to
give team members a bit of advance notice about this, so that they can already
think and prepare their own intros tailored to this project.

It shouldn’t just be about people’s names, but roles and what each person will
be doing on the project. Some further ideas:

* Highlight people’s experience and expertise, particularly if it’s going to
  benefit the project or subject matter you’re working on
* It is also important to say if any of the team members have worked on a
  previous phase of the same project/product/service
* Make sure to point out who is full time/part time or if there is any different
  working pattern (such as compressed hours, any days they are not working,
  etc…)
* Prep the client about what the day will look like and set expectations. For
  example who they should bring and what the agenda should be.

### Get to a shared understanding of what the work and priorities are

There are a number of outcomes you should aim to get out of a kick-off. This is
important especially if we are working with that client for the first time and
there are areas that are not very clear to us, or to them. You can structure a
kick-off in the way that works best for you, but some frameworks that will help
you get the outcomes you need are below:

* [Running a discovery kick-off workshop](/guides/running-a-discovery-kick-off-workshop)
* [Running a roadmapping workshop](/guides/running-a-roadmapping-workshop)

Aim to reach a shared understanding of what’s desired and what’s possible. This
can be a Sprint goal, a high level vision, or going through the requirements and
getting clarity on each of these points. The scope is flexible, and it varies
from project to project, but the main outcome is to make sure the team and the
client understand what will be done. You should:

* Set the client’s expectations from the beginning, and help them understand
  that there are trade-offs in every decision we take
* Make sure the commercial paperwork is aligned to this discussion, and if there
  are gaps or things that have been missed, bring that up, and go back to the
  commercial team to inform of any changes. It timing works out, this type of
  discussion is suitable for the delivery checkpoint forum that happens weekly
  on Thursdays at 3.30. Gurps, our Commercial Manager, joins these.

### Talk about dxw ways of working

Give an overview of how dxw works. Don’t assume that everyone in the client team
has read the original proposal or visited the dxw website. Explain how we work:

* agile mindset
* culture
* our approach to delivery
* GDS Service Manual
* sprint ceremonies
* writing stories
* story workflow (this is different from team to team)
* the code review process (again might be different in each team, and it’s ok
  for the team to define that in the first Sprint)
* dxw days, that is 9 days in a 10 day sprint
* invoicing and finances, we invoice the first day after the end of each sprint,
  based on the number of days each specialist in the team worked. We might also
  add travel costs, or research incentives, and other admin costs as per the
  commercial agreement we have with the client

It is also important to mention that we work with roadmaps, which might change
over time as we know more about the project. This is fundamental in an agile
project, so that we can react to change as quickly as possible. Therefore, we do
have plans, but they are not set in stone.

Tell the client that if, at any point, they have an issue with the way we are
working, or with any team member, the first point of contact for them is the dxw
Delivery Lead. If the DL is the problem area or if they are a contractor, the
Director of Delivery is then the next point of contact.

### Discuss how the team want to work

Clients will have their own way of working on projects and if they’ve used agile
approaches before, it may be a different flavour of agile to what the dxw team
are used to. Ask the client team to talk about how they’re used to working on
projects and agree some principles for how the single team will work together.
For example, do they typically follow the GDS Service Manual?

Explain how most dxw teams work, and communicate to the client that we’ve done
this successfully with different clients over the years. However, be
accommodating and suggest we “test and iterate” approaches. The retros are a
perfect avenue to explore these.

There’s always something to discuss here. For example, how will week notes be
written and who should they be sent to? Who needs to be invited to show and
tells? How will user stories be written? Is there a story template the team want
to use, and will developers estimate them?

### Talk about co-location

If you’re going to be co-located with the client, ask to visit the office space
and have a look around. Make sure that the team have access to the site (do they
need passes) and that you have space to work. This includes space to run sprint
meetings and show and tells. Work with the Commercial Operations team to order
any equipment or things the team will need. It’s also worth agreeing which days
will be spent co-lo and which at dxw in this meeting. Take the teams working
patterns into account.

When the team are going to be in different locations, think about technology and
how to make sure each team member is able to join meetings and work with others.
It might be useful to buy some extra microphones, good headphones or additional
screens for the team. Chat to Olivia if you have any questions.

Cover the following tech for collaboration: Slack, Google drive, Trello, Miro
boards, Google Hangouts or Go2Meeting, Calendars (team and personal).
