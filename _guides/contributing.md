title: Contributing to the Playbook
---
The Playbook is public and anyone, inside or outside of dxw, can suggest changes to it. This means you!

We manage changes via GitHub 'Pull Requests'. If you're experienced in doing this, then all you need to know is that this repository is available at https://github.com/dxw/playbook2

If creating a pull request is new to you, then don't worry, here is a guide to use Netlify CMS to create one for you.

## What you will need

You will need a GitHub account. If you don't already have one, then [sign up here](https://github.com/signup). You do not need to be added to the dxw GitHub organisation to be able to suggest changes.

## Suggesting an edit

1. Click on the yellow 'Contribute' link
2. If you are not logged in, you need to log in with your GitHub account
3. If you are asked if you want to 'fork the repo', you do.
4. Choose the page you want to edit.

   * If it is the homepage, then click 'Index page'
   * If it is one of the guides, click 'Guides' under 'Collections', and then click the guide you want to edit
   * If you want to create a new guide, click 'Guides' under 'Collections', then click the 'New Guides' button.
5. Make your edits in the 'Rich Text' editor.
6. Click 'Save' at the top of the page
7. Click 'Status: Draft' and choose 'In review'

Your suggested changes will not be live yet. Your suggestions should be available to view on the [GitHub Pull Requests page](https://github.com/dxw/playbook2/pulls). After a few minutes, you should be able to view a preview of the Playbook with your changes by clicking on the URL next to '😎 Browse the preview'

## Reviewing changes

Everyone's suggested changes that are being reviewed are publicly available. Anyone can publicly comment on a suggested change. Only GitHub accounts that have been added to the dxw GitHub organisation and staff team can 'merge' a pull request and make it live. If you are not on this list and want to be, please email [support@dxw.com](mailto:support@dxw.com) with your GitHub username.

To see the suggested changes, you can click the 'Files changed' tab to see lines of text that have been removed (in red) and lines of text that have been added (in green). Alternatively you can click on the URL next to '😎 Browse the preview' to see what the Playbook will look like if this change is accepted.

Anyone can comment on a pull request, and the more voices the better.
