## Mental and physical health support at a time of challenge or crisis

Sometimes our lives both inside and outside of work can be challenging, and many of us will experience poor mental or physical health for any number of reasons.

This can impact our lives, and sometimes our ability to work as normal. 

### Who to speak to 

#### Line manager 

Line managers are your first point of contact for any issues you may be having at work. They are responsible for carrying out dxw’s duty of care, and you should request a 1:1 with your line manager if you need additional support. 

They can listen, support and offer reasonable adjustments as detailed above. They can help review workloads, working patterns, projects, roles and responsibilities and help with resolving anything within the workplace that might be causing concern. They can liaise with delivery leads, heads of and directors where necessary, and take some of the burden from you.

#### Mental health first aiders 

If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or think that someone else is, we have a team of trained mental health first aiders who are able to provide initial support. A mental health first aider may identify an existing or imminent crisis and is able to listen and communicate non-judgementally, give initial support and then signpost information or appropriate professional help. 

First aiders are also a safe place to turn to if you are experiencing any issues with your mental health, and need to talk to someone. Conversations will be kept in strictest confidence, provided that you are not at serious risk of harm.

Mental Health First Aiders are identified in the company Directory in Breathe where you can find a direct phone number for them.

#### HR 

The HR team is a safe place to turn if you need help with your mental health or general wellbeing at work. We can work with you to identify what additional support you might need.

### Resources

If you, or someone you know is in mental health crisis and needs medical help fast:

* Ring 999 to contact emergency services
