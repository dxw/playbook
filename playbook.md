## Professions

### Leadership

At dxw, we believe that great teams need great leaders.

#### Leadership principles

Whether or not they are in a formal management role, leaders at dxw are guided by these principles.

1. **Set an example**

   Leaders at dxw demonstrate our values in everything we do. We set high standards of behaviour and inspire both colleagues and clients to do the same.

   We demonstrate fairness, integrity, and resilience, and build trust with our actions.

1. **Look after people**

   Leaders at dxw promote the wellbeing of individuals, teams and communities. We encourage a supportive culture and inclusive working arrangements. We prioritise 1:1 time with people to listen and understand their particular needs.

   We support and defend colleagues in difficult situations. We identify and deal with poor performance and bad behaviour.

1. **Take ownership**

   Leaders at dxw welcome responsibility and accountability. We’re proactive, pick up things that need doing without being asked and push to finish the job in hand.

   We’re the first to admit mistakes, apologise when wrong and learn for next time.

1. **Deliver for clients**

   Leaders at dxw understand how to deliver value for each client and create the conditions for dxw to do brilliant work. We are not afraid to challenge clients or ask difficult questions.

   We think commercially and push dxw to grow and strengthen as a business.

1. **Provide clarity**

   Leaders at dxw communicate clearly and concisely through the right channel. We question any decisions, goals or explanations that are vague or ambiguous and work to clarify them.

   We’re open, honest and straightforward in what we say and write. And we provide specific, understandable and useful feedback.

1. **Make good decisions**

   Leaders at dxw use evidence and judgement to make good decisions. We know that timely decisions are important, so we don’t procrastinate or fudge. We commit to collective decisions, particularly when we originally disagreed.

   We consult broadly, seek out contrary opinions, and listen to quieter voices. We make sure we can explain our decisions, with context, rationale and evidence.

1. **Point the way**

   Leaders at dxw share an inspiring vision for the future of dxw, and each individual’s part in it.

   On client and dxw projects, we make sure that colleagues understand the outcomes we want to achieve and the value that they will create.

1. **Build the future**

   Leaders at dxw hire great people. We actively look for the widest range of candidates to strengthen our diversity.

   We encourage our colleagues to learn, develop new skills, and pursue their career aspirations, whether at dxw or elsewhere. And we give people opportunity and responsibility at the right pace for them.

   We continually improve dxw capability, and the effectiveness and efficiency of our delivery. We try out new approaches and technologies and give others the time and space to do the same.

### Strategy

We create the conditions and in-house capability our clients need to deliver and keep improving great services.

#### Strategy team principles

The strategy team apply these principles to our work.

1. **Bring people together to make the right decisions**

   We facilitate activities to help organisations make good decisions, prioritise and create the momemtum for change.

1. **Focus on impact and sustainable change**

   We’re here to create significant long-term change. We won’t get involved if we don’t believe that’s possible.

1. **Question the brief**

   Before starting delivery we interrogate the brief to make sure it is clear, realistic and provides the foundation for delivery teams to start work.

1. **Meet organisational goals as well as user needs**

   We help organisations clarify their goals and set up the right measures to track performance and progress. So they can deliver better services for the people who need them.

1. **Use methods that work**

   We use established methods where we can, or develop new ones where we need to.

1. **Create the conditions to deliver**

   We set up teams to deliver and keep improving once we’re gone.

### Delivery management

#### Delivery management principles

Delivery leads at dxw are guided by these principles.

**Maintain diplomacy**

We encourage calmness and patience, we ensure all voices are heard in a fair way and we’re always proactive to get stuff done.

**Demonstrate leadership**

We have the autonomy to lead and to say no, we’re responsible for empowering delivery teams to do great things and we coach others to get the best from them.

**Show strength & resilience**

We protect the team so they can focus, we remove blockers and distraction and we provide context and see the bigger picture.

**Enable, empower & encourage**

We create space for the team to deliver and individuals to thrive, we build up trust with the team, our clients and our stakeholders to support decision making and progress and we’re always supportive and demonstrate positivity, with a focus on delivery.

**Prioritise learning & improving**

We actively learn from what we do and take responsibility to ensure that learning feeds back into what we do next and we stand by our ability to facilitate communication and constructive conversation.

### Product management

#### Product management principles

Product managers at dxw follow these principles.

1. **Set the destination, don’t chart the course**

   Product managers help empower multidisciplinary teams by refining and articulating the problem the team is trying to solve, and the outcomes they‘re trying to produce.

   Communicating the vision and goals for a project through a clear and well-maintained roadmap is a core part of product management.

1. **Define and defend scope**

   Getting agreement from everyone involved is crucial to successful delivery.

   Product managers should set the direction at the start of a project, and continue to articulate, communicate and defend the scope throughout, so that the team can focus on delivering.

1. **Convert insight into action**

   User research helps inform our objectives, goals, and priorities by telling us more about the problems users are having with the current state, or the needs they have for something different.

   Product managers need to be able to balance user research insights with constraints like time, capacity, and strategic objectives to prioritise the next most important thing.

   Product managers help the team to work together, across disciplines, to identify potential solutions before choosing a way forward.

1. **Have a service mindset**

   Product managers recognise that a digital product is often not the whole solution to a problem, and that the people operating a new service day to day are users too.

   We think about the processes and systems around a product, including how those might change.

1. **Communicate clearly how short term outcomes contribute to long term goals**

   Product managers need to own and articulate a vision that is consistent and meaningful to everyone with an interest in the project, from the delivery team all the way through to the most senior stakeholders, and users.

1. **Be present, collaborative, and consistent**

   Being available to the team to discuss the unexpected and share in the decision making is central to building empowered and protected teams.

   Product managers should regularly and actively communicate, review and defend our decisions - especially the unplanned or unexpected ones.

1. **Maintain a focus on outcomes**

   In the midst of delivery, key dates can loom large, and teams can be diverted onto things which seem urgent but aren‘t important.

   Product managers must help teams and stakeholders remain focused on outcomes over outputs, facilitating discussion and making space for reflection.

1. **Lead without authority**

   Product managers shouldn‘t be bottlenecks. Product managers and delivery leads work together to build skilled multidisciplinary teams and create the space in which those disciplines can do their best work.

   Product managers are open to new tools, techniques and approaches, working with teams to find what works.

1. **Take blame, give credit away**

   Good product managers leave their ego at the door, taking negative feedback on board whilst ensuring the team are rightly recognised for their work and achievements.

   Being kind is more important than being right - it‘s a good rule of thumb to enter every conversation without assuming that you already know most, or best.

1. **Strong opinions, softly held**

   Product managers make the best decisions based on the available information with confidence, staying open to the possibility that things could change when more information is available in the future.

   Product managers communicate the trade-offs they’re making and the rationale for their decisions so that teams can understand how a decision was reached, even when they don’t agree.

1. **Set clear priorities**

   Product managers work with the team, stakeholders and users to define priorities, and ensure these are clear.

1. **Measure outcomes**

   Product managers facilitate and work with service designers and business analysts to work out key metrics and goals for the product and work with the team to define roadmaps to achieve these goals.

Hat tip to [Ross Ferguson](https://medium.com/@rossferg/the-principles-that-make-me-a-better-product-manager-9e50814d184f) for inspiring several of these principles.

### User research

At dxw, we believe in making decisions based on evidenced user needs. As user researchers, we help multidisciplinary teams learn about users and recognise the value of user research. There is no single right way of doing this, but as a team, we need to stay unified in the way we approach, do, and talk about research.

#### User research principles

Our principles are not rules. They guide our work, keep us improving as a team, and working with, not for our clients.

1. **Help teams understand people**

   Researchers at dxw help our teams build a deep understanding of the people who use our services. We know that‘s the best way to create public services that work well for the people who need them.

   We are facilitators, not gatekeepers. We actively involve our colleagues and clients in research. And openly share what we do, how we do it and why it‘s important.

1. **Find the truth. Tell the truth**

   Researchers at dxw create strong evidence and reliable answers so our teams can act with confidence. We are bold and focus on what‘s most important.

   We know we can learn things that are unexpected and challenging. So we communicate clearly and sensitively to help everyone make the best decision.

1. **Take ethics seriously**

   Researchers at dxw know that the safety and trust of participants is our responsibility. We think about the ethics of our research at every step. From how we recruit participants and get their informed consent, through how we store and use the data we collect, to how we share our findings.

1. **Be methodical, but not rigid**

   Researchers at dxw know that the quality of our findings depends on the quality of our methods. We use tried and tested methods, and take time to reflect and continually improve our practice.

   But we also understand that context is important. So we use the best approach for the question at hand and adapt our ways of working to fit the client and the project.

1. **Learn, share and adapt**

   Researchers at dxw work in an agile way. We do research and analysis in small batches so we can continuously share and adapt to what we learn.

1. **Make research inclusive**

   Researchers at dxw know how important it is that public services work for all the people who need to use them. We help teams understand the needs of all their users, and do research activities that everyone can participate in.

1. **Build on existing evidence**

   Researchers at dxw help clients build on the knowledge and data they already have. We combine existing knowledge, poorly understood data and new research into a coherent picture.

1. **Accept and admit constraints**

   Researchers at dxw do the best research we can within the constraints we have. We acknowledge and share the limits of our research and our findings. And we advocate for more research when it‘s needed to achieve the project outcomes.

#### User research guidance

The Playbook includes detailed guidance on [how we do user research at dxw](https://playbook.dxw.com/#/guides/how-we-do-user-research).

The guide starts with the user research workflow, which describes the things that user researchers usually do on projects, and then provides further guidance and links to resources for specific topics.

### Design

#### Design team principles

Designers at dxw follow these principles:

1. **Democratise the design process**

   Take into account, and value highly, the input of others in the design process. While we are ultimately responsible for design in a delivery team, we don’t work in isolation.

1. **Value clarity in everything we do**

   Use plain language in interfaces, writing and conversation.

1. **Overlap with other disciplines**

   Work closely with people that have different skills to you, in the knowledge that different perspectives make our decisions stronger and elevate our work.

1. **Communicate constantly**

   Never go missing. Our teammates always understand what we’re doing and why, because we’re all aiming for the same outcome.

1. **Know we are not the user**

   Do not assume to know how users of our services think or act. We acknowledge that things such as genetics, upbringing, religious and geographical culture, and past experiences make us all different. We work closely with our user researchers to gain understanding and insight about the people that use the things we design. _“One accurate measurement is worth more than a thousand expert opinions.”_ ~ Grace Hopper

1. **Be educators**

   Know that being open about our work, and helping others to understand our decisions and why we make them, benefits everybody.

1. **Be kind**

   Be tolerant, understanding, empathetic and compassionate. Look for opportunities to help and care for others. Putting people at the centre of everything will help you be a better designer.

1. **Embrace questions**

   Understand that when people ask questions and give feedback it is to make something better. If we can not articulate our decisions then we may not have made the best choice.

1. **Ask questions**

   Always ask questions and seek the truth;  when we understand the problem we can solve it. When things seem muddy take a step back and try and find the original intent or gaps in understanding. _“If I had an hour to solve a problem I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.”_ ~ Albert Einstein

1. **Always assume the best intent**

   We are passionate about what we do, but we are a team. When you have difficult conversations or feedback we should always assume that it is coming from a good place.

1. **Tell stories**

   When we talk about our work and why we do what we do, do not just state the facts. Inject some humanity into it; turn it into a story with a beginning, a middle,  and an end.

### Development

#### Development principles

1. **Solve real user needs**

   Good code starts with understanding, and is rooted in the real world. We work
   in multi-disciplinary teams, but you’re not just there to churn out code. Get
   involved in the research and design. Understand the needs of the users and
   the constraints of the organisations we’re working with.

   Ultimately, it’s about the user and their needs, not about technology.
   Sometimes software is not the answer.

1. **Own your code, but collaborate**

   Having the opportunity to see a piece of work through to completion is a
   great way to get stuff done, and for developers to grow. Take ownership of
   your work to get it all the way through our development process to being used
   by users.

   Ownership gets stuff done, but collaboration makes it better. So involve the
   rest of your team in your work: agree approaches, highlight tradeoffs and
   seek out reviews. Get all your code reviewed by another developer to help us
   ship better quality code, get the opportunity to learn new skills, and
   increase the shared knowledge of our products. Request feedback, ask
   questions and discuss code, but ultimately the author is responsible for
   making changes.

1. **Security is a user need**

   Sometimes the simplest or easiest solution is not the most secure, and we
   fight for our user’s safety and security, even when a client doesn’t agree.

1. **Use simple, conventional technology**

   By default, use straightforward technology and conventional approaches. The
   services we built have to be maintained and iterated on by small, and
   sometimes less experienced, teams. Keeping things simple ensures that is as
   painless as possible.

   Vary from convention only on the domain specific stuff, where it adds the
   most value.

1. **Build for quality and consistency**

   Think about those who come after us. We build high quality systems with the
   lowest possible maintenance burden. We write tests, use linters, follow
   standards and conventions, and document our decisions. The things we build
   should be set to thrive after we leave.

1. **Improve with each iteration**

   Always leave the codebase in a slightly better place than when you found it.
   Look for opportunities to refactor difficult code, to improve documentation,
   or to extract shared functionality.

1. **Communicate clearly and frequently**

   Help our future selves and others by recording the reasons for our actions.
   Explain the changes you’re making to code through your commit messages and
   pull requests. Explain the decisions you’re making about technology through
   architecture decision records. Explain the tradeoffs you’re making in
   planning and show and tells.

   Use straightforward language, even when you’re dealing with complex technical
   issues. Prefer to write it down over speaking it out, to ensure a lasting
   record.

1. **Be humble, supportive and open minded**

   Assume other people on your team know things you don’t. Feel comfortable
   saying “I don’t know”.

   Assume you know things other people on your team don’t, but be prepared to be
   wrong. Ask questions rather than giving instructions. Share your opinions and
   experience openly with your team.

   Question the obvious and test our assumptions. Listen to the client and the
   users and their experiences.

   Be non-judgemental – assume everyone did the best they could at the time,
   with what they knew and the resources available.

1. **Always learning. Always teaching**

   Technology never stops, and the amount to know even for our limited stack is
   huge, so we must learn and share. We teach each other through peer mentoring,
   pairing and reviews.

   Share what you learn on a project with the whole team so we can reuse
   knowledge across projects. Encourage others in their learning.

1. **Do the smallest amount of good work**

   We aspire to regularly ship good code, and deliver it to the users as often
   as possible. Delivering impact fast by shipping something real has a big
   impact on the morale of the team and happiness of our clients and users.

   Where you can, do less and deliver it sooner. Break down work into smaller
   pieces. Descope anything that isn’t critical for a first version. Do a
   minimum slice that works for some of your users. Anything to reduce the time
   between get started on something and delivering it to users.

   Work at a pace that suits the project. Hacky is sometimes fine. If you’re
   working on prototypes then do only what you need to answer your questions.
   Sometimes, if you’re working on critical production systems, you’ll have to
   go slower. When that’s the case, it’s even more important to break down the
   work into the smallest reasonable chunks, to demonstrate progress, to make
   reviewing the changes as easy as possible, and to prove your assumptions.

1. **Work in the open**

   Be open by default. Code should be public unless there’s a good reason
   otherwise. Changes to open source libraries should be contributed back to the
   project. Dashboards should be public wherever reasonable.

   The way we’re working should also be open to our clients. Work being done
   should be represented in Trello boards that everyone can see. Communication
   should be done in public Slack channels rather than direct messages. Openly
   communicating about our work allows clients to see how we’re doing, and what
   needs their attention, and gives everyone in the team context for the work
   being done and decisions being made.

### Commercial Operations

We are the team that enables and encourages dxw to achieve its mission(s) and uphold its values.

#### Commercial Operations Team Principles

##### Things we do:

1. We deliver the dxw business plan. In particular, we recruit the best people to meet our mission, manage our finances to allow sustainable growth, and track performance of objectives to measure ourselves.

1. We are the front door for staff and clients. We help, support and enable dxw to meet its mission and uphold its values. We do this by being empathetic and put people over process.

1. As commercial experts we take the burden away from our delivery teams, and make sure our people, as well as our suppliers get paid, whilst also ensuring our clients pay us on time.

1. The unit of delivery is always the team, so we ensure staff wellbeing by providing a safe and inclusive environment. We also support our people to thrive in all stages of their careers, ensuring they have chance to continually learn, as well as excellent facilities and the right tools to enable them to succeed in their careers.

1. We ensure dxw is compliant with all the relevant company and employment regulations, ensuring we have ISO 27001 accreditation, abide by GDPR guidelines and insurance.

1. Commercial and business operations can be thankless, but to manage expectations we remain resilient and take responsibility for our work by effectively communicating about what we do and why we do it.

##### Behaviours

1. Empathetic to our users / staff / suppliers / clients.

1. Support each other to support the team.

1. Commercial accuracy and responsibility.

1. We are balanced, organised and resilient.

1. People over process, to maintain our unique, small-company, culture.

1. We are proud of what we do and are confident enough to talk about it.

1. We manage expectations by taking responsibility for our work and communicating what we do and why.

1. We _are_ the company values.

### Sales and marketing

#### Sales and marketing team principles

The sales and marketing teams at dxw follow these principles:

1. **Start from solid foundations**

   We work with potential and current clients to understand their needs and how we can deliver value - seeking out   opportunities for mutual growth.

   We support our clients to make the right buying decisions, ensuring we focus on positive outcomes for users and making the most of the resources available.

   We work closely with our delivery team so we can be open with clients about who will be available to do the work and realistic delivery timescales.

1. **Build positive relationships**

   We work in partnership with our clients, and are open and transparent at all times.

   We remain responsible and accountable to both our delivery teams and clients, ensuring that we represent them in the right way and can deliver on our commitments.

   We give our clients the opportunity and platform to talk openly about their experience of working with us.  We listen to what they’re telling us - about what’s going well and what we need to do differently - and constantly work to improve things.

1. **Find the right work**

   We welcome new opportunities, and actively seek input from the dxw team to help us decide whether an opportunity is ‘dxw shaped’.

   We consider the ethical implications of the work - does it help to create better digital public services that make people’s lives better?

   We will only take on work that’s a good fit for the team - that won’t put us under undue strain, where our team will be safe and we can have a positive relationship with our client.

1. **Show the work and the team**

   We’re an active part of the digital and tech community that’s working to build better public services.

   We talk openly about what we’re doing and why, what we’re learning along the way and share our ideas and expertise. We blog all the time.

1. **Have a clear voice**

   Whenever we communicate - online or face-to-face - we’re always clear, to the point, friendly, and professional. You can rely on us to say it like it is.

   We champion the things that matter to us and our clients. We’re bold and pragmatic and seek to influence change for the better in the way public services are created and delivered.

1. **Communicate with a purpose**

   When we communicate, it’s to explain what we’re doing and the impact of our work so our clients and potential clients understand our areas of expertise and how we can help them.

   We’re open about our values and the way we work in dxw digital. We give our team members a voice because we’re proud of our diverse and inclusive culture.

## Working here

### Managing your day to day work

#### Working hours

Our working hours are 10:00-18:00, Monday to Friday. Some people work different
hours by arrangement. Anyone is free to do that as long as their hours of work
don't make it hard for other people to get things done. For example, many people
arrive earlier than 10:00 and leave earlier, which is generally fine.

Each team has a short standup every morning, where we each tell the whole team about
a single thing we will get done that day. If you think you're going to be late, you should
let everyone know in the project Slack channel.

Most developers have maintenance responsibilities, which they do during [ticket
time](#ticket-time).

We do our very best to [work at a sustainable pace](#work-at-a-sustainable-pace). But
sometimes, when we're approaching a firm deadline or a launch, or a client is
having an emergency, we work longer hours than normal. From time to time,
there's an emergency that means we have to work during unsociable hours to solve
the problem. Neither of these happen very often, but they are a normal part of
life at dxw.

Sending emails or posting in Slack outside of working hours can be a good way to get things off your mind,
but it can create an unintended sense of urgency for the people who receive your message. Try to avoid creating
that urgency when it’s not necessary. For example, by specifically saying that you don’t expect an immediate response.

Unless they are actually urgent, you can ignore messages you receive
outside of working hours and handle them when you are back at work.

#### Working days

##### Monday to Thursday

**Client facing**: We charge clients “time and materials” for the work we do, based on a [per person day rate](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-10/documents/92768/432689933684667-sfia-rate-card-2018-05-23-1413.pdf). We generally schedule team members to work on particular projects for a whole sprint at a time, and track and bill that time in half days and whole days. Delivery leads work with the finance team to track and invoice the time of the team; having regularly patterned working helps the process to run as smoothly as possible, without confusion and without taking more time than needed. Any working arrangement needs to make it straightforward to track, report and invoice for your time.

When working on a project we work as a single multi-disciplinary team. We’re often working on phases of projects where there’s a lot of unknowns and a lot of learning, so we use agile approaches and strongly favour being able to work together on problems. That’s often easier when co-located, particularly when working with clients, pairing, or participating in workshops. Any working arrangement needs to support active synchronous collaboration with the team.

**Internal facing**: Internal facing roles, in which time is not billable to a client, have a more regularly structured five day working week. Everybody is encouraged to take part in Friday work, at least occasionally.

##### dxw days

We regularly come back together as a team to work on our own projects and processes, normally each Friday. These dxw days are important for us to maintain our strong culture and identity, separate from the clients we work for. Our sprints start on a Wednesday and end on the Tuesday two weeks later.

#### Working from home

Generally, we work either at our office or at client sites. But it's usually
fine to work from home from time to time, or in order to complete a specific
task. If you're working apart from your team, it is essential that you remain
contactable and productive, and the onus is on you to be especially
communicative.

If you are working from home, you must record this as an absence in BreatheHR.
There is a category, "WFH", for this purpose.

#### Reporting your time

Everyone who works on a client project at dxw is responsible for reporting the time they spend on projects. We usually work with our clients on a [time and materials basis](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-pay-for-digital-outcomes-and-specialists-services#time-and-materials), so it’s important we can accurately track and report how our time is spent on client projects.

We use [10,000ft](https://app.10000ft.com/) to schedule our work, which helps us to forecast our capacity over future weeks and months in a reliable way.

We track our time at the same level of granularity that we bill it – for almost everyone in the team, that’s half days or whole days.

##### What to do when reporting your time

When reporting our time, we follow these guidelines:

* If what was scheduled matches reality, simply confirm this time.
* If you worked on a named project (client or internal including "dxw Support"), that differs from the schedule, record your time as that.
* If you worked on something else, leave the time blank or zero out what you were scheduled to work on.
* If you were away on planned leave, confirm your time as "Out of office".
* If you were off sick, record your time as "Sick".
* If you had unplanned leave, record your time as "Out of office".
* If you were away due to a regular day off, as part of your working pattern, leave the time blank or zero out what you were scheduled to work on.

If you’re not doing client work, then unless you’re working on one of a handful of named internal projects or support, you don’t need to record your time against any other piece of work – the assumption is you’re doing valuable work, whether it’s learning, helping with recruitment or improving our tooling and processes, and we don’t need itemised time tracking to justify that.

We’ve set up the platform, so that it understands individual team members’ working patterns. This means the team don’t need to worry about entering in their non working days.

Our delivery leads lend a helping hand when delivery team members aren’t sure how to record their time – they’ve been doing this for a long while and have a well developed sense for it.

#### Getting things you need

Anytime you need to order something, notice a problem in the office (e.g. a broken chair or dripping tap) or you need some help with your laptop or the printer - there is a Slack channel for it. If in doubt, please speak to the Commercial Operations team and they’ll point you in the right direction.

#### Claiming expenses

From time to time, some of us spend our own money at work. Most often, this is
things like:

* Train fares for unexpected travel
* Refreshments purchased for meetings with clients
* Stationery/materials, especially for workshops or events

dxw will always pay expenses which are:

* __Necessary__: We only expense things we need in order to be able to complete
  our work
* __Proportionate__: The total expense should be proportionate to the
  work at hand. In general, we try to avoid spending lots of money. For example,
  unless you have a good reason, don't get a cab to a meeting when you could get
  a train.

Wherever possible, it's best to check that expenses can be reclaimed before
incurring them.

We manage expenses using Xero. For more information about how to do this, see
the [guide on claiming expenses](/guides/claiming-expenses)

#### Calendars and documents

We use Google Apps for Work to manage calendars, write and share documents.
There is a dxw folder where we share most of the things we write. If you can't
see it when you log in to Google Drive, you'll need to ask someone else to send
you the link, and then click "Add to drive".

When we write new things, we try to save them in a sensible folder within the
existing structure.

#### Internal tech support

If you experience problems with the office printers, wi-fi, video conference
set-up, Macs etc… You may send a message in the **#help-techsupport**
Slack channel.

#### Using a personal device at work

Most of us use at least one personal device as part of our work, because it's
more convenient than carrying lots of devices around. However, no one is
obligated to use a personal device for work. If you need a dxw-provided phone,
tablet or other device, please ask for one.

Anyone who does use a personal device must take reasonable care to ensure that
it cannot compromise dxw's security. This includes implementing prudent security
measures, being mindful that your personal devices could be targeted as part of
an attack on dxw or its clients. For example, you might receive an email to your
personal email address designed to trick you into revealing a work-related
password.

Exactly what security measures are prudent may vary depending on the device and
what you're using it for. Some good practice examples are:

* Configuring screens to lock after a period of inactivity
* Ensuring that
  work-related data on the device is regularly backed up
* Encrypting storage
* Using good passwords and changing defaults
* Avoiding connecting devices to untrustworthy networks (internet cafes,
  security conferences, unencrypted (open) wifi networks, etc)
* Disposing of your device securely when you no longer need it

If you need to use a personal device but cannot take these sorts of measures,
you should get permission first.

#### Report a lost or stolen device used for work

Submit an urgent ticket by sending an email to support-emergency@dxw.com stating which work device was lost or stolen and when the incident had occurred.

Our support staff will be immediately notified, at any time of day.

#### Data protection

Though dxw doesn't control much personal data, our clients generally do. And
some of it may be held on sites that we host. Everyone at dxw has a
responsibility to keep that data safe, and process it in accordance with the [data
protection
principles](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act).

In particular, we:

* Only process personal data as part of work on the service that we're
  contracted to provide to a client
* Don't access personal data unless we need to in order to do our jobs: don't
  read people's personal data or private communications without good reason
* We do not ever disclose people's personal data to anyone outside dxw unless
  specifically instructed, and are satisfied that it is legal to do so

If you have any questions about data protection, talk to Harry.

#### Protective marking scheme

Some information that we have is confidential. We use a protective marking
scheme so that everyone understands how to handle this material, and who they're
allowed to disclose it to. All of the documents and data we hold will fall into
one of the categories below.

* __Management-in-Confidence__: internal documents whose circulation within dxw
  needs to be restricted.
* __Company Confidential__: information owned by dxw
  which would be of value to those outside the company, such as competitors, and
  whose loss or theft would potentially damage the company.
* __Client Confidential__ or __Commercial in Confidence__: information owned by
  dxw or its clients, which needs to remain confidential between dxw and the
  client.
* __Unclassified__: information, which would not be of significant commercial
  value to those outside dxw.

Some of our clients also have protective marking schemes. For example, all
central government bodies will apply the [Government Protective Marking System
(GPMS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251480/Government-Security-Classifications-April-2014.pdf).
If you are in possession of materials that are protectively marked using other
schemes, treat them as company confidential.

We take care to handle all data carefully, but when information is protectively
marked, extra requirements apply.

Because we value openness highly, we take care not to over-classify information.
We don't protectively mark information unless there is a good reason to keep it
confidential.

##### Management-in-confidence

This category is used only for dxw's most confidential information. For example,
employment records, salary details and company strategy documents.

Do not share any information with this marking with any person, whether internal
or external to dxw.

This information:

* Must be clearly labelled or described as "Management-in-confidence"
* When printed
  * Stored only in a locked container
  * Transported only via courier, recorded delivery or personally by dxw staff
  * Destroyed by cross-cut shredding when no longer required
* When digital
  * Stored in an encrypted format
  * Communicated only when encrypted or via an encrypted connection, unless emailed from one dxw.com address to another

##### Company Confidential

This category is used for information which should not be communicated outside
dxw. For example, details about how we operate security controls or internal
discussions about client work.

Exactly the same controls apply to this information as detailed under
Management-in-confidence, with the exception that Company Confidential
information can be shared within dxw as required.

##### Client Confidential or Commercial in Confidence

This category is used for information which is disclosed to a limited group of
people external to dxw, or which is unclassified information we have received
from clients. For example, dxw proposals, presentations for pitches or planning
documents.

Unless otherwise specified, all unclassified information we receive from clients
falls into this category.

This information:

* Must be clearly labelled or described as "Client Confidential" or "Commercial in Confidence"
* When printed:
  * Stored out of sight
  * Destroyed by cross-cut shredding when no longer required
* When digital:
  * Stored in an encrypted format when on exchangeable media or a mobile device

As a rule of thumb, label a document as Client Confidential if it mostly
contains the client's confidential information, or Commercial in Confidence if
it mostly contains dxw's.

##### Unclassified

Anything not captured by the sections above is unclassified. Examples are
external marketing material, general emails and letters.

Beyond a general duty to treat information carefully, unclassified information
is not subject to any specific restrictions.

#### Email autoresponder

If you require an out of office message on your email account please send
your request to support@dxw.com with the subject title **Email Autoresponder**
which must include start date, the contact details for another member of the
team for any urgent queries, and return date to be added to our mail server.

**Note:** please use Helvetica or Arial as the font in your emails.

### Your pay, pension and other benefits

All perks and benefits are available to the dxw team after the successful passing of their probationary period.

#### Changes to your details

Please tell us promptly if your name, address, telephone number, next of kin details or banking
details change.

#### Cost of living raise

dxw will institute a cost of living raise each year on 1st April. The percentage
will be set by the [CPI Index](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices)
as of 1st April each year.

* If you have passed your probation, you will receive your raise in the April payroll.
* For those team members who joined prior to 1st April of that year, but haven't yet
  passed probation, you will receive your raise in the month you successfully complete it
  and it will be the same percentage as of 1st April CPI that year.
* If you joined on or after 1st April (that year), you will not be eligible for a cost
  of living raise until the following April.
* If you are leaving during April you will not receive the cost of living raise.

#### Pensions

dxw provides a pension which is operated by Aviva. Once you have passed your 3
month check in, you will be auto enrolled into the scheme, receive details by
post of the necessary employer/employee contributions and have the option to set
your percentage or opt out.

dxw will match any contribution up to 5%.

Your contribution will be relief at source, with 0.8 deducted from your monthly
salary and the additional 0.2 added from tax relief.

For more details on Relief at Source, please visit the [Aviva website](
https://www.aviva.co.uk/retirement/news-views/report/making-sense-of-tax-relief-on-pension-payments/).

#### Holiday

If you want to take time off:

1. Discuss the dates with your team and delivery lead

   This gives them a chance to manage any impact it might have on the wider team and the project.

1. Request the holiday through BreatheHR

   We use BreatheHR to track who's off and when, so we can plan for it. Your line manager can then see and approve your request.

1. Add your holiday to your Google calendar

   If someone is trying to find out where you are, or when you're available, the first thing they'll check is your calendar.

   When you are on a client project, you may also need to add your holiday to a shared or team calendar. Check with your delivery lead.

Your line manager will normally approve requests that are for 10 days or less and made at least 4 weeks in advance. Anything longer or requested with less notice will need to be managed to understand its impact on client, team or personal work.

When your planned leave has been approved, update the schedule in 10,000ft to reflect this. This helps us to look ahead and is recorded as “Out of office". Each member of our delivery team uses the tool to record the days they work on client projects on a weekly basis.

There is more information about dxw's holiday arrangements in your contract of employment.

#### TOIL (Time off in lieu)

Where possible we try to keep a sustainable pace of work and avoid working outside normal hours; occasionally this might not be possible.

##### How is TOIL calculated?

TOIL (time off in lieu) is awarded when you work over and above your contracted working hours continuously for a period of time or when you attend/travel to an event outside of your contracted working hours. TOIL should be agreed with your delivery lead or line manager ahead of doing the extra work.

We encourage you to use your TOIL within the two weeks of extra work or event attended as it's meant to be for resting and making up for working  at a sustainable pace.  We know this may not be feasible in every case so please speak to your Line Manager or a member of the HR team if you have any questions.

There are two options of how to use your TOIL, you can calculate the amount of hours you have accrued (ie half a day) and take it off at once or take a couple of hours a day spread over a period of time. Planning when you’ll take TOIL is important, particularly if you’re working on a billable project so please speak to your Delivery Lead before doing any overtime and arrange when you’ll be able to take the time back.

##### How to request TOIL?

Using BreatheHR similar to the way that you request holiday there is a TOIL drop down, please write a note as to why you are requesting the leave and this will be approved by a member of the HR team. Please note this will not deduct from your holiday allowance shown on your BreatheHR dashboard.

#### Sickness

If you are sick, you must let us know by 10:00, or as soon as is reasonably
practical. Do not come to the office. If you come to the office when sick, you
may be sent home again.

If you're sick but able to work, you can work from home. Everyone at dxw should
have a laptop, and should generally take it home with them in case it's needed.
If you're sick and at home but don't have your laptop, it can be couriered to
you.

When you return to work, you must check that your sickness has been correctly
recorded in BreatheHR, and update it if necessary. If you're sick for more than
a week, you'll also need to provide a [fit
note](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-fit-note-a-guide-for-patients-and-employees).

If you're sick on more than 10 occasions or for more than 10 days over a
12-month period, we'll invite you to an absence meeting to discuss your
situation. We may agree with you an action plan and/or a review period. We may
seek medical advice. Should your attendance fail to improve after a three-month
period, we will invite you to a further absence meeting to discuss your
situation. In this meeting we will also give consideration to your possible
dismissal.

We'll also invite you to an absence meeting if you're off sick for more than
three weeks on a single occasion. In addition to the above, we will seek to
support your return to work and discuss with you any temporary or permanent
adjustments which may assist you. If you are unable to return to work in your
current role we will consider if there is a suitable alternative role. If we are
unable to reach an agreement that will permit you to return to work, we will
give consideration to your possible dismissal.

We will always only consider dismissal after we have exhausted all other
reasonable options.

#### Compassionate leave

If you need to take compassionate leave, let your line manager and a member of the HR team know, so we can support you in the right way. If you are on a project, we can then work with your delivery lead to manage the impact on the team.

To record the compassionate leave in BreatheHR, choose Other as the Type of Leave, and choose Compassionate as the Reason.

#### Parental leave

While many terms around parental leave are gendered, gender is not a factor in what
leave you are entitled to. What matters is whether or not you are pregnant.

##### If you're pregnant

If you're pregnant, you’ll probably be entitled to [Statutory Maternity Leave (SML)
and Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/leave),
which is funded by the government. They will pay you 90% of your normal salary
for the first six weeks of your leave.

Assuming you are entitled to SMP (almost everyone is), dxw will also pay you 90%
of your salary for the second six weeks of your leave. This contribution
is called Occupational Maternity Pay (OMP). Taken together, this means that
you’ll have twelve weeks of leave on 90% of your normal salary.

To be eligible for OMP, on returning to work you will need to stay at dxw for at
least three months full time (or proportionately longer if working part-time).
If you decide not to, you will have to repay any OMP you received.

When you know you are pregnant please do tell us as soon as possible, so we can
check that your working arrangements are safe for you and also ensure you are
paid for time off for antenatal appointments.

##### If you're not pregnant

If your partner is pregnant, you are adopting, or you are having a baby
through surrogacy, you’ll probably be eligible for [Statutory Paternity Leave (SPL)
and Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP)](https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave). SPL
may be taken for one or two consecutive weeks, between the date of birth and 56
days afterwards. SPP is £145.18 per week.

If you qualify for SPL and SPP, dxw will instead pay you your normal salary for
three weeks of paternity leave. If you want to take more than three weeks of
leave you can use [shared parental leave](#shared-parental-leave).

##### Shared parental leave

If you're having a baby, adopting a child, or having a baby
through surrogacy, you may be eligible for [Shared Parental Leave and
Pay](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay). If you're interested in
taking this up, please talk to the People Manager.

##### Keep in touch (KIT) days

You have 10 paid KIT days to take during your parental leave if you wish to come in
for departmental meetings, events or just to spend some time in the office.

Any bank holidays that you miss while on parental leave will be added to your
holiday entitlement when you return to work.

#### Childcare Vouchers

The Government closed the Childcare Vouchers scheme to new entrants on 4th October 2018. This means we are no longer able to add new members to the voucher scheme with Busy Bees.

The government has introduced new ways to help parents with childcare costs which you access directly: [https://www.gov.uk/get-tax-free-childcare](https://www.gov.uk/get-tax-free-childcare)

For more information, please speak to the People Manager.

#### Flexible working

Our policy is informed by the way we work and the way we charge clients for our time.

##### Overall requirements

**Client facing**: Any working arrangement needs to allow you to participate in most Fridays and be around for the important start-of- and end-of-sprint ceremonies.

**Internal facing**: Working arrangements for these roles are slightly more flexible as the delivery needs listed above are not relevant.

##### Part time working

The normal working pattern is 5 days per week, Monday–Friday.

**Client facing**: We’re happy to talk about a 4-day week, on the basis of a fortnightly pattern to accommodate our Monday–Thursday billing week and attending some Fridays. It may be possible for some roles to work a 3 day week due to the nature of the role potentially not being full-time on a single project, this would be dependent on a number of contextual factors and discussion with the team. We’re unable to support a 3-day (or fewer) week for all other roles due to the overheads for scheduling.

**Internal facing**: We’re happy to talk about part time working for any number of days, dependent on the role.

Part time hours spread over 5 days, e.g. working 21 hours across a full week, or roughly 4 hours a day, may be possible for internal facing roles after discussion, but is likely a no for client facing roles.

Salary and holiday allowances (including bank holidays) will be prorated for part time roles.

For example, when working a 4 day week, the pro rata leave allowance will be 20 days per year of annual leave and 6.5 bank holiday days, giving a total leave allowance of 26.5 days. Bank holidays that don’t fall on a non-working day must be booked as annual leave.

##### Core and non-core hours

Everybody is expected to work seven hours a day. Normal office hours are 10am–6pm.

If you’d prefer to start a little earlier and finish a little earlier (say 9am–5pm), this is definitely OK and can happen without any formal discussion for all roles.

If you’d prefer your working hours to start after 10am or finish before 5pm (still keeping to seven hours), we’re happy to discuss this and either **might** be possible. The impact of this would be less for internal facing roles than for client facing roles, but both would require a discussion.

Salary and holiday allowances would remain the same.

##### Compressed hours

Compressed hours involves working your full hours in fewer days. For example: 35 hours in 4 days, 9.30am–6.45pm.

We don't offer compressed hours for client-facing roles due to the complications for the way we bill our time and present our services to clients.

We are happy to have a discussion about compressed hours for internal-facing roles but cannot guarantee this would be an option.

35 hours in 3 days, for example, is a no across all roles. It goes against our encouragement of [sustainable pace](#sustainable-pace).

For working patterns with the same number of hours each day, holiday allowance can be treated the same as for [part-time roles](#part-time-working). For working patterns with varied hours, the annual allowance for both holiday and bank holidays should be counted in hours (231 hours per year) and bank holidays that fall on working days must be booked as leave.

##### Remote working/location

Generally, we work either at our office or at client sites.

We’re happy to support working from home from a logistical or well-being related perspective. While we don’t support fully-remote roles (legacy arrangements being the exception), we can look at anything from 1–3 days per week following a discussion.

If you need to work from home for a one-off thing then that doesn’t require contractual arrangement – just talk about it with your team before the day, make sure you note it in your calendar and include it in your standup note that day.

##### Requesting a change of working arrangement

If you would like to discuss a change to the standard working pattern, you can either speak to your Head-of directly, or, contact the People Team to facilitate and support this conversation by phone, email, slack or in one of our bi-weekly HR surgeries. In this initial conversation, we will discuss your request, look at the impact on the team and your work, agree the best time for this arrangement to begin and how it will be communicated to those necessary.

If you have an alternative working arrangement, you should make sure it’s reflected in your calendar so the rest of the team can be confident in knowing when you are and aren’t around.

#### Grievances

If you have a grievance about your employment or a complaint about another
member of staff, talk to the Managing Director as soon as possible.

The first step is to discuss the problem to see if it can be quickly resolved.

If this discussion does not satisfactorily resolve the problem, you should put
details of your grievance in writing and send it to the Managing Director. They
will arrange a meeting to discuss the matter, at which you may be accompanied by
a colleague or trade union official. Following this discussion the Managing
Director will provide a written response.

If you disagree with this response or the matter remains unresolved, you may
appeal by respond in writing. A further meeting will be arranged and the
Managing Director will again respond in writing. This decision will be final.

#### Disciplinary procedure

If you do something that we feel constitutes misconduct, or your performance in
your job has been poor, we'll talk to you about it. Hopefully, there's just been
some misunderstanding, or some problem that's easy to solve and won't recur.
Formal action will not be taken without careful investigation of the facts.

If we feel it's appropriate, we may verbally warn you, explaining what has been
unacceptable and what you need to do to improve your conduct or performance.

If your conduct or performance fails to improve following a verbal warning, or
if the matter is serious enough that a verbal warning is not appropriate, we may
hold a disciplinary meeting at which you may be accompanied or represented by a
colleague or trade union official. Following this meeting, we may:

* Conclude that no misconduct has taken place, or that there is no poor performance
* Issue you with a written warning, which will explain:
  * The nature of the misconduct or poor performance
  * The change to your behaviour or performance that you need to make
  * The time within which the change needs to be made
  * The consequences of not making the change (for example, dismissal)
* In cases of gross misconduct, dismiss you without notice

If you disagree with the outcome of this hearing, you may appeal against the
decision. You must do this in writing. If you do so, your appeal and the
circumstances of your case will be reviewed by a member of staff who has not
been involved in your case before. That member of staff and the Managing
Director will then meet to discuss your case, and will either uphold the outcome
or schedule another disciplinary meeting. dxw's decision following that meeting
will be final.

### Supporting your development and wellbeing

#### People manager and HR surgeries

The bi-weekly HR surgeries are there to give an opportunity for members of the team to discuss matters they might not feel able to raise with buddies/delivery leads/line managers or that are specialist to the HR function in dxw.

The list is not exhaustive but some topics might include:

* Holiday
* Sickness
* Pay
* Expenses
* Parental Leave
* Accessibility
* Probation
* Pensions
* Occupational health issues
* Contractual matters
* Working patterns/locations
* Training and career progression
* Diversity
* Inclusivity
* Stress management
* Interpersonal issues
* Bereavement
* Grievance and disciplinary matters
* Facilitation/scheduling of conversations with Directors/heads-of, such as Salary Reviews

Bookable slots are available on Wednesdays and Fridays at 11am but the People Manager’s door is always open.

#### Line managers

Line management at dxw is not about hierarchy, it’s about providing professional guidance and support.

Line managers ensure that team members are clear about their roles and responsibilities at dxw, and how well they are doing at achieving them.

Individuals should be proactive in taking responsibility for their own development, but line managers will provide advice and support to help team members meet their agreed short and long term goals.

HR support line managers with advice and guidance on recruitment, onboarding, probation, performance, sickness and any other specialist knowledge.

You can find out who your line manager is in BreatheHR on the summary section of your profile page.

##### Line management principles

###### Communicate clearly
Communication is a two-way process and it is important to check understanding and confidence, and value the other person in decision-making. Explaining the task and its objectives clearly means people know what’s expected of them and the part they play. It empowers them to take responsibility and own how they approach the work.

###### Recognise achievement and celebrate success
A simple ‘thank you’ shows someone that what they have done is appreciated, and is hugely motivating. Celebrating major, and minor, achievements is an important part of our culture at dxw. It builds team spirit and morale.

###### Guard our values
Lead by example. The actions and behaviours of line managers must always demonstrate our dxw values. We should always hold ourselves accountable to our values, and encourage the same in all of our colleagues, including those we line manage.

###### Continuous constructive feedback
Find out how each of your team members prefers to receive feedback, and develop an approach which reflects that.  Ongoing positive and constructive feedback is essential if someone is to feel valued, learn from their experiences and become better at what they do.

###### Be honest
Being honest means telling the truth and being consistent in what you say and who you say it to. Telling things as they are, while being sensitive to the situation and individual, ensures that people know where they stand and will help to build mutual trust and respect.

###### Wellbeing
Line managers look out for the health and wellbeing of the team. They are responsible for carrying out dxw's duty of care to its people.

#### One-to-ones with your line manager

##### Purpose

For your manager to help you with your personal and professional development, your wellbeing, and to build a trusting relationship between the two of you.

##### Overview

These meetings are about you; ideally you will feel happy driving the meeting. If you’re not confident doing this, or are unsure how best to approach it, your manager will help you to get there.

##### Agenda and topics

Coming to your 1:1s with a list of things you’d like to discuss will help you make the most of the time. Some things you might find productive to talk about include:

- **Your career and growth goals:** Don’t assume your manager knows all your aspirations. Bring them up in your 1:1s. Your manager understands you won’t work for them forever and they want you to have a happy, fulfilling career — whatever that means to you. Tip: if you want to talk about your long-term goals but feel uneasy about it, ask your manager to do the same.
- **Team improvement:** Have an idea that will help your team to work better? Use your manager as a sounding board to help you refine and implement your suggestion.
- **Self improvement:** Got a specific thing you’d like some help, coaching or feedback on? A technical skill or a soft skill? Your 1:1 is the place to bring it up. Remember that you can use the 1:1s that fall between career progression reviews to discuss any of the proficiencies you’re currently trying to level up on.
- **Personal issues:** Anything going on outside of work that’s affecting your wellbeing? Physical or mental illness, bereavement, family issues, stress? The more you can tell your manager, the more they can try to help, and make accommodations for you at work.
- **Interpersonal issues:** Having problems with a coworker? Your manager can help mediate or coach you through how to deal with the issue.
- **Retrospection:** If at any time you feel like your 1:1s aren’t particularly productive or helpful, or you’d like to change something about them, don’t hesitate to bring this up with your manager.

##### Frequency

1:1s should happen at least once per fortnight. Where possible they’ll be face-to-face, either in the office or out for a walk, or a coffee. Where that’s not possible, remote is perfectly fine. There’ll always be a Google Meet link in the calendar invite.

If you need to reschedule your 1:1, let your manager know at the earliest opportunity.

##### Meeting length

An hour or so, at least once every two weeks, is a good standard to aim for. If you meet weekly, a little shorter is fine.

##### Additional resources

Here's [a template for helping to prepare for a 1:1, and making notes during it.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rCoFGtvbBI2FYhp-4EYMRokB--E8RHs_BleQqNwD0Rk/edit#) Feel free to make a copy and alter it according to your own needs.

Here’s a great article on [7 ways to prepare for an effective one-on-one meeting with your manager.](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/03/7-ways-to-prepare-for-an-effective-one-on-one-meeting-with-your-manager/)

#### Personal learning and development allowance

We have an annual allowance of £750 and up to 4 days per person, to be used for a range of professional and personal development activities like workshops, short courses or conferences.
dxw pays for the event ticket, travel, and accommodation, but you will need to cover your own costs for food, drink and supplementary equipment.

You should discuss your training plan with your line manager, they will help you identify potential areas for development and support you to find suitable events or training.

You may also use the allowance to attend a non role based conference or event focused on improving your health and wellbeing. You will receive two days off for this, and can top up the time from your annual leave allowance.

Attending conferences and events that are not related to your role, is a taxable benefit. As your employer, we will make the declaration, HMRC will then adjust your tax code accordingly to collect the tax via PAYE.

##### How it works

The allowance will be available to everyone once they have completed their probation period, within the dxw financial year which runs from the start of July to end June. It will be pro-rata for staff who work part-time. If you don’t spend your allowance within the financial year, it cannot be carried over.  We will start afresh each year, as part of our annual budgeting cycle. Your allowance is counted as being spent at the time of purchase rather than at time of use; for example, if you buy a conference ticket in May for an event in July the same year, the deduction will be made to the budget for the financial year that May falls within.

Any events (paid, free, speaking, etc) you attend should be logged in BreatheHR as a training request. If they do require payment, please include weblinks and an estimate of the ticket, accommodation and travel costs (up to the maximum of £750, though you are welcome to pay the difference for more expensive events). This helps manage the annual budget and will give you a great view of what you have attended in the year.

It’s ok for members of the team to go together, but we need to ensure that training days have the lowest impact on client work, so there may be times we need to consider whether your request is possible. Our Director of Delivery will help with prioritisation in those circumstances.

We know that lots of training isn’t paid for, and involves things like coaching and mentoring, learning from colleagues, being an active part of networks, and other self-directed learning. We will encourage and support people who want to use unbilled days for different types of professional development.

If appropriate, it’d be great if you would talk about your experiences in a blog post or bikeshed - sharing good events and useful training will give others the opportunity to attend.

At the end of each financial year we will review our financial position with the intention of increasing the annual allowance.

If you have any questions, please contact the HR team.

#### Book purchase

If there is a book relevant to your work that you would like to read, make a request through the #help-purchasing slack channel and the Bus Ops team will buy it for the library.

#### Cycle to work scheme

dxw operates a cycle-to-work scheme, which may allow you to purchase a bicycle
at reduced cost. If you would like to take this up, please register
[on the cycle scheme website](https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/18eb71)

#### Eyecare vouchers

dxw provides eyecare for the team via a voucher system run by ASE Corporate Eyecare Ltd and Boots.

Details of what the wellbeing voucher offers can be found here: [Eyecare for Wellbeing](https://www.eyecareplans.co.uk/corporate-eyecare/eyecare-for-wellbeing/).

[Apply for a wellbeing eyecare voucher](https://gw.eyecareplans.co.uk/dxwe12q2415d3df)

#### Backpack and other personal equipment

dxw will pay for the equipment needed to enable you to work comfortably and safely. dxw also offers a budget of £25 towards a work backpack. Use the help-purchasing Slack channel to request any equipment you need, or talk to anyone in business operations if you are unsure if a purchase will be covered.

#### Support paths

##### Helpers

When you join dxw you will be assigned a helper. This person will work closely with you for at least your first 4 months. They will do a similar job to you, help you meet members of the wider team, catch up with you on at least a 3/6/12 week basis to ensure you are receiving everything you need, and will NEVER get bored of your questions!

If you feel that you’re not getting as much time with your helper as you’d like, please speak to the People Manager.

As a helper, you will be vital in ensuring you have the regular catch ups - if you are finding it hard to schedule them, please do talk to Bus Ops.

For more information on being a helper, please see the [checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dc3IRZ_ze7QzMQTHO70ZC6hU8cig5ds7LN2MoHmPBe8/edit) or speak to the People Manager.

##### Buddies

Once you have passed your 4 month probation, we would like you to choose a buddy within the company to support you.

We recommend this person **doesn’t** work directly with you, someone in a different role and that you don’t work closely with on projects, as this will give you a second pair of ears and a whole new set of experiences to draw on.

This is not mandatory, just recommended and similarly not everyone may wish to be a buddy - don’t be afraid to ask or say no. It can be reciprocal but doesn’t have to be.  Also, if you feel that a change of buddy would benefit you for whatever reason or that you’re no longer able to be a buddy, this should also not be an awkward situation. If you have any concerns, have a chat with the People Manager.

The buddy system is there to help us all improve, to make sure we're doing the right kind of work and to check that we're dealing with practical problems we're facing. It's not line management, so it's not the right place to talk about holiday, salary, sickness, absence or anything disciplinary. If you need to talk about those things, talk to the People Manager.

If you want to know more about how the buddy system works, how often to meet and suggested discussion topics, see the buddy [crib sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBKwPLFsGWUUzeYAObcFLQJyTPknkLhm2HrbuHwxelU/edit?usp=sharing). This shouldn’t be a huge time commitment, ideally just a pleasant Friday meet up.

##### Your delivery Lead (for those on client work)

There will be opportunities within the delivery team to raise any issues or concerns you might have e.g. retrospectives or planning sessions. As well as this, or if you’d prefer to talk one on one, the delivery lead working on the project will be available to provide support and guidance.

##### Directors & heads-of

All members of the Directors and heads-of team are here to help answer any questions you might have. Your own Director and/or Head-of profession or location is there to provide support on matters relating to dxw and your career with us, as well as profession specific questions. Similarly, they are here if you need to escalate any job-related concerns.

##### Our Managing Director, Dave

At dxw, all doors are open if you need to raise a concern or just have a chat - this includes our MD. Dave is always available to discuss any questions you have about the company and its future. Equally, if you feel you need to escalate anything to him, don’t hesitate to get in touch. Dave's diary is open and you can see it on Google Calendar. If you would like to schedule some time with him, please feel free to book something.

### Hiring new people

#### Basics

We use [Workable](https://dxw.workable.com) for recruitment, to help us stay
organised and keep in touch with candidates.

Each candidate moves through a number of stages before being offered a job or
declined: a screening interview via Skype or phone, an interview and a work day.
The work day includes another interview.

We feel strongly that it's important to be respectful of candidates' time and
interest in us, and that their attention is valuable. So we do our best to be
responsive, human and open. It's particularly important to give unsuccessful
candidates good, thorough feedback about why we haven't made them an offer.

#### Job descriptions

Before we decide to advertise a new job, we write a job description. This helps
us make sure we all agree on what we need, and helps candidates to know if their
skills are a good fit for the job. A good job description has three parts:

1. A description of what the person in this job will do
1. A list of their responsibilities
1. A list of the skills, experience and personal qualities they will need to be
   good at their job

There are lots of job descriptions on the website if you need inspiration. It's
important for them to be declarative ("The person with this job will...") and as
objective as possible. Throughout the rest of the process, we'll use this
document to decide what questions to ask in interviews, and to fix activities
for the work day. The skills and personal qualities need to be things that we
can have a go at understanding by asking questions and observing a candidate's
behaviour.

#### How we find people

The first way we find people is through our networks. We look for people we
know. Everyone who is willing tweets about the job and shares it on Facebook and
other social networks.

The second way we find people is by advertising. We advertise jobs on
Stack Overflow, GitHub, WorkInStartups and Unicorn Hunt. Not all jobs go on all
of these boards - we pick whatever seems most appropriate for the job.

The third way we find people is by making sure we're regularly blogging about
what we're doing, and being open about our culture, work and process. We accept
[general applications](https://www.dxw.com/jobs/general-application/) from
people who are interested in dxw but who don't fit an open job.

#### Review applications

All applications arrive via Workable. We review these applications as a team to
decide who to take forward.

An application review is a very quick process. We look at the information given
by the candidate and decide if it is likely that the applicant has the skills,
experience and personal qualities that we need. If it is likely, we progress
them to the next stage.

#### Screening

The purpose of the screening is to:

1. Introduce ourselves and explain a little more about the job and life at dxw
1. Talk to the candidate about their experience and explore why they are
   interested in the job
1. Decide whether you think they are quite likely to have the experience and
   personal qualities that we are looking for
1. Get an idea of the candidate's
   salary expectation

Try to keep the conversation quite high-level, and avoid going into too much
technical detail. This part of the process is more about experience and personal
qualities than about skills. Things to keep in mind:

* Does this person seem likely to embody our [values](#values)?
* Does this person have an interest in our [mission](#why-are-we-all-here)?
* Does this person have experience working in [agile environments](#agile-mindset)?

If you can find out how they heard about the job, that's useful for us to know.

Many people feel self-conscious when asking questions about salary, but it's
very important - and this is one of the few situations in daily life where
people expect the question and are not put off by it. If you're not sure how to
broach the topic, leave it to the end. When you're about to finish the call, you
can say something like:

"Thanks for talking to me. Before we finish, please could you give me an idea
of the salary you'd like?"

If the candidate suggests a number that is unexpectedly high or low, it's also
worth asking what they are paid in their current role.

We avoid making any commitments during this call. Near the end, we explain that
we'll be in touch soon. Don't offer an interview there and then: that's
something we agree as a team.

After the call, you can talk about the candidate with the team if you wish, or
just make a decision. If you think it's quite likely that they have the skills,
experience and personal qualities that we need, you should take them through to
an interview.

#### Interviews

Candidates who have a successful screen will be offered an interview. This is an
hour long with two members of the team.

Before going to an interview, make sure you have:

* Set aside enough time for the interview. You should leave half an hour each
  side in case the candidate is early or the interview goes long.
* Read the job description
* Read the candidate's CV
* Read the questions for the interview, and thought about whether they are the
  right things to ask

dxw interviews are informal. They are a semi-structured conversation, rather
than a Q&A. We do not recite the list of questions or keep verbose notes on
replies. The questions are there to ensure that you don't forget to cover
important ground, and as a prompt when the conversation naturally dries up.

Start with a couple of questions, and then allow the conversation to evolve
naturally. Ask questions about things they say, and try to go into more detail
on the points that you think will help you to assess their skills, experience
and personal qualities. Keep the job description in mind: this should always be
your frame of reference.

At the end of the interview, always ask the candidate if there's anything they
would like to ask you. If they have questions, answer them honestly. If they ask
about salary at this stage, or have a concern or question about the job that you
don't feel comfortable addressing, tell the candidate we'll get back to them and
make a note for an appropriate colleague to call them.

When everything's done, we thank the candidate for their time and then return to
the office and discuss the interview. As soon as possible, we put a thorough
update on Workable. This update should include the good things and bad things
about the candidate, a recommendation on whether to take them forward, and a
rationale for that recommendation. It is very important that this update is
detailed enough for us to understand what happened and why, long after everyone
involved has forgotten all about it.

If you think the candidate is very likely to have the skills, experience and
personal qualities we need, you should take them through to a work day.

The work day interview is exactly the same as the first interview, but with
different members of the team and different questions. Usually, it happens in
the first hour of the work day.

#### Work day

TODO. This section to cover:

* Principles for a good work day
* Preparing a work day activity
* Letting the candidate know if they need to bring anything and how much time
  we'll need
* Making sure there is a printed or emailed explanation for what they need to do
* Discussing the results
* Offer if we are sure they are right

#### Offer, joining and probation

TODO. This section to cover:

* Salary negotiation, notice periods and start date
* Eligibility to work in the UK, documentation that we need
* Background check
* Starters checklist
* The probation period, meeting and expectations
* ...more things.

#### Returners' programme

dxw is proud to offer return to work opportunities for experienced hires who are looking to re-enter the workplace after an extended period of time away.

We’re running a pilot to begin with to see how this works for us and the people joining us. We’ll start by taking on one or two people for 3 to 6 months - depending on the role and circumstances. There’s potential to become a permanent member of the team at the end of the placement, but this isn’t guaranteed.

Initially this opportunity will only be offered within our London team, with a view to including our Leeds office as the team there grows.

##### Who supports you?

You will be supported by our people team from the point of application.

If you’re invited into our recruitment process, it will consist of a one hour interview followed by a collaborative activity with the team which will be sent to you 24 hours in advance so you have time to prepare.

The interview will be an informal, semi-structured conversation where there will be the opportunity for us to learn more about you and your experience and, just as importantly, for you to get a feel for what it’s like to work at dxw.

If you join us, you’ll be continuously supported by our people team, a line manager and a mentor within the same field. You‘ll have regular check ins with the team where you can speak openly about anything that’s on your mind.

##### Client facing role

For client-facing roles we’ll start billing your time back to the client when we feel the time is right. This will be something we discuss openly during the recruitment process and through your regular check ins.

#### Internal facing roles

We’re also offering internal facing roles, for example, in our busy commercial and marketing teams who also support our sister company, Tradecraft. These roles are not billed back to our clients.

If you think this might be for you, please apply through our jobs page.
