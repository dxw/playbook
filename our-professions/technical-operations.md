#### Technical Operations team principles

1. **Learn don’t blame**

   Things/Mistakes happen, treat it as a learning experience rather than finding
   blame.

1. **Documentation is the first step to automation**

   For most tasks you need to understand it enough to document it before you can
   begin to automate it.

1. **Don't be a keeper of secrets**

   Everyone should be replaceable in respects to knowledge. It's everyone's
   responsibility to share what they know (eg. Pairing)

1. **No heroics - Don't internalise problems**

   Situations occur where there is pressure to deliver/maintain/fix, it's a team
   effort, not always the same person's job.

1. **Be patient**

   Be helpful not obstructive. It’s easy to get frustrated by things in time
   sensitive situations – don’t!
