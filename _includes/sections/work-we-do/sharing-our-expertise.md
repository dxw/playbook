### Sharing our expertise

#### Hosting events

We host a variety of face to face and online events to share our experience and
expertise.

We work hard to design events that are accessible, inclusive and safe. We ask
attendees about their individual access and support needs.

We publish a code of conduct for all the events we host. And we expect the hosts
of events we are involved in to apply similar standards to the conduct of their
sponsors, event organisers and participants.

#### Attending events

We all go to work-related events and conferences, sometimes for work and
sometimes in our personal time.

No matter what capacity you’re attending an event in, you are a representative
of dxw. What you say and do will influence the way people think about the
company. It’s important that you make a positive impression and follow the code
of conduct for the event.

We encourage everyone to network and talk about dxw’s work. Remember to tell
people if we’re hiring and point them to our careers page on the dxw website.

#### Speaking at events

Speaking at events is a great opportunity to represent dxw.

If it’s an event around your personal speciality (front-end development, sysops,
UX etc), feel free to stick to any personal branding, slide format, or talk
style you might have already developed. At the start of your talk however,
please introduce yourself as being from dxw, talk about what the company does,
and what you do here.

If it’s an event more around dxw’s focus (public sector events, dxw projects,
public-sector specific topic etc) you should use
[dxw’s branding and slide templates](https://v-df7640e636dddb2c9710.brand.madebyfieldwork.com/).
Introduce the company in full and what your role is.

It takes time to prepare talks that work well. If you need help or advice please
ask for it in the [#dxw-marketing](https://dxw.slack.com/archives/C0K5DRKU6)
channel on Slack.

It’s also good to blog after the event, to share the content or to talk about
your experience and what you learned.

If you need time to be set aside to prepare or follow up a talk, talk to your
delivery lead and see what’s possible.

#### Our blog

At dxw, we encourage people to blog regularly. Both on the
[dxw blog](https://www.dxw.com/blog/), and on personal and community blogs.

We blog because we want to share what we’re doing and what we’re learning with
the public sector digital community. We work in the open and are keen to share
our knowledge, express our values and get people thinking about how to improve
services for the public sector.

When we’re hiring, we also want potential new staff to be able to to get to know
us beforehand.

When we blog we use the dxw [tone of voice](/guides/tone-of-voice).

We record ideas for blog posts and the schedule for publishing on
[a Trello board](https://trello.com/b/otR1Mmjv/dxw-blogging-and-case-studies-schedule).
This is managed by the marketing team, who can offer you help and advice on
ideas and support with writing if you need it. They will also manage the final
sign off and publishing of posts. Get in touch through the
[#dxw-marketing](https://dxw.slack.com/archives/C0K5DRKU6) channel on Slack.

#### Twitter

The marketing team run dxw’s
[official Twitter account](https://twitter.com/dxw).

When we tweet we use the dxw
[tone of voice](https://playbook.dxw.com/#/guides/tone-of-voice).

We encourage people to work openly and to tweet about the work they’re doing,
their learning and ideas from their own accounts. You should be careful not to
share any confidential information and check that people are content before
using any pictures of them. Remember that you are representing dxw whether or
not you identify yourself as working here in your Twitter profile.
