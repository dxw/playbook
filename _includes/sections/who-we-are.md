## Who we are

dxw is an independent digital agency that works with the public and third
sectors.

Since 2008, we’ve worked in partnership with our clients to improve people’s
lives by designing, building, operating, and improving digital public services.
We support the public sector teams we work with to build their own digital
capability and take an iterative user-centred approach to service design.

The challenge facing the public sector today is a significant one. There’s more
pressure than ever to deliver online services quickly and save money. It’s a
huge job and, in addition to talented in-house teams, the sector needs expert
suppliers who share their values and understand how to work with them.

We want people’s experience of public services to be positive and seamless. That
means creating great services that are accessible to everyone. Our approach is
to add value early and often, rapidly researching, testing, learning, and
delivering on time. Wherever we can, we work in the open, sharing our code, and
what we’ve learned.

Our aim is to help the public sector make the most of the opportunities digital
offers to make services better for the people who depend on them. And,
ultimately, to free up more resources for essential front line services like
education, health and social care, housing, welfare, and policing.

### Our values

We think that it's very important to have a talented team if we're going to
succeed. But just as important as raw talent is our ability to work well
together. These are the values that we aspire to, and help each other to
achieve.

#### Helpful

We are helpful, useful and expert. We give practical and pragmatic advice to
each other, and to our clients.

#### Positive

We are positive, cheerful and supportive. Even in crisis, we stay optimistic. We
[assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith)
and offer constructive challenge.

#### Reliable

We are reliable, consistent and committed. We make every effort to live up to
each others' expectations, and to exceed the expectations of our clients.

#### Honest

We are honest, trustworthy and straightforward. We give plain-spoken, frank,
accurate feedback and advice, and we never mislead or obscure the issue at hand.

#### Curious

We are curious, diverse and creative. We help each other to learn and improve
and we're sensitive to each others' needs. We love technology and finding new
ways to solve problems.

#### Determined

We are determined, discerning and motivated. We believe in high standards, we
enjoy doing things properly, and we're loath to settle for less.

### Our principles

These principles help us live up to our [values](#our-values), and guide our
behaviour and decision making in all the things we do at dxw.

#### Start with people and their needs

At dxw we want to create public services that work well for everyone who depends
on them.

We start by understanding the different people who will use and be affected by a
service. Wherever possible we work with them to design and test the things they
will use.

We actively consider the intended and unintended consequences of our work on
people, communities and the planet.

#### Keep an agile mindset

At dxw, we think that agile is a mindset that’s accepting of change, curious
about trying new approaches to make things better, and values careful planning
in short chunks.

We think that the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) contains a lot
of wisdom, but we don’t follow the industry of methodologies, training and
certifications that has grown up around it. We think agile is something you
learn to be, not something that you learn to do.

We recognise the importance of compliance and governance, so we build those
activities into each step.

#### Work at a sustainable pace

At dxw, we work at a sustainable pace. We estimate work and schedule it
conservatively, and set realistic expectations with clients about the pace of
delivery.

This doesn't mean that we don't work hard. Being productive is a vital part of
maintaining the trust that our clients give us, and it’s important not to let
them down.

#### Balance openness and confidentiality

dxw believes it's best to be open about what we're doing. We encourage our
clients to do the same, as does the
[service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). We talk, blog and write
about what we're doing, and we are open about as much as we can.

At dxw, we release [code](https://www.github.com/dxw), publish our
[contracts](https://www.github.com/dxw/contracts) and things like this Playbook
and talk with people about what we're up to because we believe that we'll
ultimately have more opportunities to work, grow and improve than if we kept
everything to ourselves.

However, there are some things that we must keep private.

- Our clients trust us to host content that is not public, like upcoming
  announcements and discussions made as part of formulating new policy. This is
  not our information to be open about, and it's very important to keep it
  confidential.
- We also hold some personal data about and/or on behalf of our clients. We
  never share any of this data, including contact details. See also:
  [data protection](#data-protection).
- We are sometimes sent documents that are
  [protectively marked](#protective-marking-scheme), and we have a scheme of our
  own. Information in these documents is confidential.
- Information about work that is currently being procured (whether we are
  bidding or not) and any other information that could damage the commercial
  interests of a client or supplier

#### Diversity and inclusion statement

At dxw, we value people and want them to feel free to be themselves.

We embrace each other's differences, in gender, religion, beliefs, ethnicity,
disability, age, sexual orientation, neurotype, nationality, and identity. We
are diverse - like the people we build, design, and create for.

Amazing things happen when we collaborate together. We work in the open and
believe everyone's voices should be heard.

We recognise individual needs and aim to provide a work environment that is
accessible, welcoming, and empowering for all. We want everyone to feel
supported and included in our wider community.

Our [values](#our-values) are more than just words on a page - it’s about
constant action and holding ourselves to account.

We’re committed to being transparent with our diversity information and
regularly assessing the impact of all our policies and practices.

Thank you for being you - it makes us better.

#### Reduce our impact on the environment

At dxw we are working to become a more environmentally sustainable company.

We are focusing on three main areas to reduce our impact:

- In our **offices** we recycle waste where possible. We are switching to
  environmentally friendly office supplies and refreshments, and changing to
  renewable energy suppliers.
- We are aware that the **digital services** we provide have a significant
  environmental impact. We are finding ways to reduce our contribution by
  building our products efficiently and using renewable energy for hosting.
- Whenever possible we **travel** by public transport, and we often work
  remotely to reduce the need for travel. Due to client needs this isn’t always
  possible but we’re investigating how to offset our carbon footprint.

### Our Advisory Council

dxw does not have external investors or shareholders. To help keep us honest, we
are very lucky to have a voluntary Advisory Council, made up of a small group of
senior figures, who meet quarterly to discuss and provide guidance on our
strategy, business plan and other topics related to company health and
progression. The group have a wealth of experience of public and private sector
work, as well as being friends of dxw that share our values.

### This Playbook

This Playbook is our reference for who we are and the way we do things.
Something canonical that tells us what the current “right way” to do things is.

If you’re a current or potential client, this Playbook is also for you. To help
you understand us and how we can work together.

We [continually update](/guides/managing) the principles and guides in our
Playbook. Because we’re always exploring better ways to get things done. What’s
written here is the way we do things now. Until we find something better, and
write that down.

This Playbook was originally inspired by
[Thoughtbot's excellent playbook](https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/). Thanks,
Thoughtbot!

#### Updating the Playbook

This Playbook is a collaborative effort. Anyone at dxw can and should edit it.
So if you spot something that’s wrong, feel free to hop in and correct it.

But remember that this Playbook is the result of our conversations about how we
should do things, not a substitute for one. So don’t make changes unless they
reflect our shared agreement about how things are going to be done.

This document is also public, because there is very little about our process
that cannot be open. But there will be some things that should be private. So
don't forget that changes here get published to the world.

To update the Playbook, follow the
[guide to Contributing to the Playbook](/guides/contributing) and use
[dxw Tone of voice](/guides/tone-of-voice).
