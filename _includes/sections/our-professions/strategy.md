### Strategy

We create the conditions and in-house capability our clients need to deliver and
keep improving great services.

#### Strategy team principles

The strategy team apply these principles to our work.

1. **Bring people together to make the right decisions**

   We facilitate activities to help organisations make good decisions,
   prioritise and create the momemtum for change.

1. **Focus on impact and sustainable change**

   We’re here to create significant long-term change. We won’t get involved if
   we don’t believe that’s possible.

1. **Question the brief**

   Before starting delivery we interrogate the brief to make sure it is clear,
   realistic and provides the foundation for delivery teams to start work.

1. **Meet organisational goals as well as user needs**

   We help organisations clarify their goals and set up the right measures to
   track performance and progress. So they can deliver better services for the
   people who need them.

1. **Use methods that work**

   We use established methods where we can, or develop new ones where we need
   to.

1. **Create the conditions to deliver**

   We set up teams to deliver and keep improving once we’re gone.
