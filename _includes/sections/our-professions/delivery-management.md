### Delivery management

#### Delivery management principles

Delivery leads at dxw are guided by these principles.

**Maintain diplomacy**

We encourage calmness and patience, we ensure all voices are heard in a fair way
and we’re always proactive to get stuff done.

**Demonstrate leadership**

We have the autonomy to lead and to say no, we’re responsible for empowering
delivery teams to do great things and we coach others to get the best from them.

**Show strength & resilience**

We protect the team so they can focus, we remove blockers and distraction and we
provide context and see the bigger picture.

**Enable, empower & encourage**

We create space for the team to deliver and individuals to thrive, we build up
trust with the team, our clients and our stakeholders to support decision making
and progress and we’re always supportive and demonstrate positivity, with a
focus on delivery.

**Prioritise learning & improving**

We actively learn from what we do and take responsibility to ensure that
learning feeds back into what we do next and we stand by our ability to
facilitate communication and constructive conversation.
