### Development

#### Development team principles

1. **Solve real user needs**

   Good code starts with understanding, and is rooted in the real world. We work
   in multi-disciplinary teams, but you’re not just there to churn out code. Get
   involved in the research and design. Understand the needs of the users and
   the constraints of the organisations we’re working with.

   Ultimately, it’s about the user and their needs, not about technology.
   Sometimes software is not the answer.

1. **Own your code, but collaborate**

   Having the opportunity to see a piece of work through to completion is a
   great way to get stuff done, and for developers to grow. Take ownership of
   your work to get it all the way through our development process to being used
   by users.

   Ownership gets stuff done, but collaboration makes it better. So involve the
   rest of your team in your work: agree approaches, highlight tradeoffs and
   seek out reviews. Get all your code reviewed by another developer to help us
   ship better quality code, get the opportunity to learn new skills, and
   increase the shared knowledge of our products. Request feedback, ask
   questions and discuss code, but ultimately the author is responsible for
   making changes.

1. **Security is a user need**

   Sometimes the simplest or easiest solution is not the most secure, and we
   fight for our user’s safety and security, even when a client doesn’t agree.

1. **Use simple, conventional technology**

   By default, use straightforward technology and conventional approaches. The
   services we built have to be maintained and iterated on by small, and
   sometimes less experienced, teams. Keeping things simple ensures that is as
   painless as possible.

   Vary from convention only on the domain specific stuff, where it adds the
   most value.

1. **Build for quality and consistency**

   Think about those who come after us. We build high quality systems with the
   lowest possible maintenance burden. We write tests, use linters, follow
   standards and conventions, and document our decisions. The things we build
   should be set to thrive after we leave.

1. **Improve with each iteration**

   Always leave the codebase in a slightly better place than when you found it.
   Look for opportunities to refactor difficult code, to improve documentation,
   or to extract shared functionality.

1. **Communicate clearly and frequently**

   Help our future selves and others by recording the reasons for our actions.
   Explain the changes you’re making to code through your commit messages and
   pull requests. Explain the decisions you’re making about technology through
   architecture decision records. Explain the tradeoffs you’re making in
   planning and show and tells.

   Use straightforward language, even when you’re dealing with complex technical
   issues. Prefer to write it down over speaking it out, to ensure a lasting
   record.

1. **Be humble, supportive and open minded**

   Assume other people on your team know things you don’t. Feel comfortable
   saying “I don’t know”.

   Assume you know things other people on your team don’t, but be prepared to be
   wrong. Ask questions rather than giving instructions. Share your opinions and
   experience openly with your team.

   Question the obvious and test our assumptions. Listen to the client and the
   users and their experiences.

   Be non-judgemental – assume everyone did the best they could at the time,
   with what they knew and the resources available.

1. **Always learning. Always teaching**

   Technology never stops, and the amount to know even for our limited stack is
   huge, so we must learn and share. We teach each other through peer mentoring,
   pairing and reviews.

   Share what you learn on a project with the whole team so we can reuse
   knowledge across projects. Encourage others in their learning.

1. **Do the smallest amount of good work**

   We aspire to regularly ship good code, and deliver it to the users as often
   as possible. Delivering impact fast by shipping something real has a big
   impact on the morale of the team and happiness of our clients and users.

   Where you can, do less and deliver it sooner. Break down work into smaller
   pieces. Descope anything that isn’t critical for a first version. Do a
   minimum slice that works for some of your users. Anything to reduce the time
   between get started on something and delivering it to users.

   Work at a pace that suits the project. Hacky is sometimes fine. If you’re
   working on prototypes then do only what you need to answer your questions.
   Sometimes, if you’re working on critical production systems, you’ll have to
   go slower. When that’s the case, it’s even more important to break down the
   work into the smallest reasonable chunks, to demonstrate progress, to make
   reviewing the changes as easy as possible, and to prove your assumptions.

1. **Work in the open**

   Be open by default. Code should be public unless there’s a good reason
   otherwise. Changes to open source libraries should be contributed back to the
   project. Dashboards should be public wherever reasonable.

   The way we’re working should also be open to our clients. Work being done
   should be represented in Trello boards that everyone can see. Communication
   should be done in public Slack channels rather than direct messages. Openly
   communicating about our work allows clients to see how we’re doing, and what
   needs their attention, and gives everyone in the team context for the work
   being done and decisions being made.
