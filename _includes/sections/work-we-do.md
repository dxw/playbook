## The work we do

### Sales

#### Typical projects

Most of our projects are to research, design , build and support digital
services for the public sector and organisations focused on work for ‘public
good’. Broadly speaking, they are usually transactional services
([making payments, bookings, reporting things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN5B9rL_Hxs)
or informational services ([corporate websites](https://www.judiciary.uk/),
[campaigns](https://firekills.campaign.gov.uk), intranets) . Sometimes they're a
bit of both.

In so doing, we try to make sure that the organisations we're working with will
be able to operate their new services well and sustainably. This sometimes
involves work that an agency might not normally do, like advising an
organisation's leaders on how their teams could be restructured, or on what
their digital strategy could be.

With the development of dxw digital’s strategy team, we are increasingly
targeting more strategy-shaped opportunities, to help our clients prepare for,
or improve the delivery of digital projects.

We also help clients host some of the services that we build, and by selling
subscription-based products that are related to the rest of our work.

#### Opportunities

We bid on opportunities through a range of channels.

Some of our opportunities arrive directly, often via email, as a result of
recommendations, word-of-mouth or through our active engagement and networking
in the digital and public sector community.

We also take on work that is received for existing services via helpdesk
tickets.

Most of the larger opportunities we bid on arrive via more formal channels like
public sector framework agreements such as the Digital Marketplace.

When any opportunity arrives, we record it in our CRM tool, Hubspot. This
happens automatically for opportunities published on the Digital Marketplace
Outcomes and Specialists framework. Other opportunities are entered individually
into Hubspot if they arrive to a specific person.

We record as much information as we can about opportunities when they arrive. An
opportunity should be described in enough detail that someone else in the team
could pick it up and work on it if needs be. That means that we always record a
sensible name, the details of the organisation and where possible, we associate
the opportunity to the Hubspot contact and company record of the person we're
talking to. If they have provided any documents, we upload those into Hubspot as
well.

Opportunities go through several stages during their life, to show whether we're
waiting for more information, waiting for a meeting, writing a proposal and so
on. For opportunities that we’re bidding on via the Digital Marketplace, our
process mirrors the timelines buyers publish in alignment with these standard
procurement rules.

When the process ends, a lead will either be [won](#winning-work) or
[lost](#losing-work).

#### Screening potential projects

At dxw our mission is to help create public services that improve people’s
lives. Whether we achieve this depends a lot on the work we choose to do. We
encourage an open and honest discussion about which work we take on. And we
actively seek different perspectives, both inside and outside of dxw.

To decide whether a potential project is ethical and supports our mission, we
consider:

- **Value**

  The work is beneficial to the public, the client and dxw.

- **Practicality**

  We can produce a great result within the likely constraints.

- **Culture**

  We can work together with the client, the users and other stakeholders in ways
  that support our [values](#our-values) and [principles](#our-principles).

#### Matching people to projects

We understand that members of staff may have ethical, religious or other
concerns about working on a particular project. If you do have concerns about a
project, please raise them with your line manager or head of profession.

#### Budgets

Clients aren’t always able to talk about their budgets, but
[we do need to know](https://medium.com/@monteiro/why-i-need-to-know-your-budget-a61ec864c898).
If they absolutely can't tell us, we do our best to estimate at what it probably
is, based on the information we have.

Where we don't think we could do what the client needs within their budget, we
explore alternative options with them that are more affordable. Sometimes this
works out, sometimes not. That's ok. Where it does, it tends to be because we've
made a good case that it's better to have a small feature set that works really
well than a large one that's slightly disappointing.

Where clients have a larger budget than we think they need, we say that too.
This usually means explaining why we're able to do the work for less than they
thought. We also think about what extra things we could do to improve their
chances of success and suggest extra work they could do.

Where a budget is disclosed that's more than we think is necessary, we usually
propose a piece of work that uses that budget fully. But we're always open, and
tell them that we've done this, and that we'd be delivering more than the
minimum. And we're always happy to win a smaller bit of work than the client
thought they'd need. We try to structure these proposals so that the extra work
is easy to remove.

#### Sales meetings

Wherever possible, we meet prospective clients before writing a proposal. This
is because face-to-face conversation is the most efficient way to communicate,
and the projects we bid for are often complex. Sometimes, this meeting is the
way we qualify an opportunity.

By the end of this meeting, we should make sure that we understand:

- Who the client's users are
- The user needs the client is trying to meet
- Their current vision for how those needs will be met
- Any notable technical requirements
- What the project's budget and deadlines are
- How many suppliers are likely to be bidding
- When they need to receive our proposal by

This meeting usually involves quite a bit of discussion about the project. In
those discussions, we speak freely and openly, offering advice where appropriate
and making any suggestions we might have. We always try to be as
[helpful](#helpful), [positive](#positive) and [creative](#curious) as we can.

It's important that we use this meeting to find out the information that we need
to write a good proposal. But it's just as important to prove our expertise, to
deliver value early and to leave the client with a positive first impression.

#### Proposals and tenders

If the project is being tendered via a fixed process (such as the Digital
Marketplace, ) we'll respond by following the process that the client requests.

Bid writing is a team sport at dxw, so it’s important to involve the potential
delivery team in the planning, writing and reviewing of the bid. This is
important as it helps to set the team up for a successful pitch (if we need to
do one) and eventual delivery if we win the work.

Whilst the process tends to be similar, not all opportunities are exactly the
same, for example, sometimes we’ll be provided will a form to complete, and
other times we’ll have more flexibility on the format of our proposal.

If we're writing a proposal following our own format, we often start from a
proposal template. The main things we’ll often need to write are:

- A description of the project's background. How did they get to the point
  they're at now?
- A description of the client's vision. What are they trying to do?
- An initial set of user needs. How does the client believe their service or
  project will make things better for these people?
- Details of how we’ll approach the work
- A proposed team to do the work, their roles and profiles.
- How many sprints we estimate we will we need to deliver the work.
- A timeline for when we expect the sprints and other work will happen.
- A cost for the work.

There are lots of examples of these proposals that anyone at dxw can read if
they like.

#### Winning work

When we win work, we mark it as Won in Hubspot. We amend the budget, closing
date and services sold if necessary. We write to the client to thank them and
ask them for a convenient time to meet and talk about how and when we’ll start
the work. We talk to the scheduling team and add the project's sprints and other
work to our scheduling tool 10000ft, so that the team can see who's working on
what. And we talk to the finance team so that invoices can be created as drafts
in our finance system Xero, so we don't forget to bill them.

#### Losing work

We don’t always win work we bid for, particularly when it is run via a
competitive tendering process, such as on the Digital Outcomes and Specialists
framework.

When we lose work, we mark it as Lost in Hubspot. We write to the client to
thank them for their interest and ask them for any feedback they might have. We
usually also say that we'd be happy to talk about any future work they might
have. We record the main reason we didn't win the work in Hubspot along with the
detailed feedback.

We do our best to incorporate this feedback into future bids.

Some opportunities, upon review with the team or following discussions with the
client, turn out not to be dxw-shaped things. This could be for lots of
reasons - capacity, capability, location and so on. This is okay. When this
happens, we update the client as soon as we can, explaining the reasons for our
decision. We mark these opportunities as No bid in Hubspot, recording the main
reason we made this decision, along with any context.

### Building services

#### Client experience

##### Responsiveness

One of the things our clients value most is responsiveness. Many will be under
pressure to get things done quickly, and will be expected by their colleagues
and managers to know what is going on at any given time, and to manage us
effectively. If we're not quick to respond to their queries, questions and
concerns, we reduce their ability to maintain the confidence of their
colleagues.

So, when we are on sprints, we endeavour to respond to our client quickly. It's
not always possible to resolve a problem or get an answer quickly, but that
shouldn't stop us from acknowledging a message or giving regular updates. As
with [tickets](#be-responsive), being responsive to a query is just as important
as giving a definitive answer.

When we get enquiries for clients who are not currently sprinting, we still
answer as quickly as we can - but clients who are sprinting come first.

We also expect most communication with clients to happen with the project's
delivery lead. We don't hide anyone on the team from the client, and they are
free to ask questions of whomever they wish. But if you're a developer and you
get a question that's really for a delivery lead to answer, refer the client on.
This will help to keep you productive, and will help the client understand who
on the dxw team does what.

##### Progress in every sprint

Delivering projects in an agile way requires trust between everyone involved in
delivery. Clients must have confidence in us for the process to work. One of the
quickest ways to lose confidence is to finish sprints with little to show for
the effort we've made. In all of our work, we maintain a clear relationship
between sprints and their associated costs, and visible, tangible changes to the
service we're working on.

This means that we structure work so that visible progress and supporting
back-end work happens side-by-side. We don't work on back-end or supporting code
first, and then bolt front-ends on later. We make sure that what we're doing is
visible to our clients as early as possible. This helps us to maintain trust,
and gives us more opportunities to learn what works and what doesn't by
involving users of the service in testing.

##### Involvement

We involve clients in every aspect of our work. Projects work best when everyone
involved feels part of the same team. So, other than the internal retro, there's
no aspect of our process that we do without client involvement.

In particular, we should go out of our way to involve clients when decisions are
being made about design, user needs, or strategy (among other things). We're not
here to make decisions for our clients: we're here to help them to make good
decisions themselves. So we shouldn't make decisions about important things
without them.

This isn't to say that we require clients to participate in everything. Clients
and projects have varying needs, so this aspect of the process is flexible. But
we always make the option of involvement available. If they want to join daily
standups as well as participate in sprint planning, they can.

#### The structure of a project

At dxw we follow the Government
[Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and our projects move
through discovery, alpha, beta, live and retirement phases.

One change to our approach is the addition of an **Inception** phase at the
start of a project, before discovery. We think this phase is necessary to set up
a single team with our clients, establish ways of working, and get everyone
behind a shared vision and goals for the project.

At a high level, we believe the purpose of each phase is:

**Inception**: Establish a single, multi-disciplinary team with the client.
Bring everyone together for a kick-off session to agree principles for how we'll
work together. Run a roadmapping workshop to define a set of goals and vision
for the project. The roadmap also clearly defines dependencies and risks, and a
list of things to learn or prove to form the basis of a user research plan.

**Discovery**: Carry out research to define users and understand their needs.
Document findings, user needs and user journeys. Sometimes this phase also
involves conducting technical discovery work to look at different technologies
and solutions that might meet users' needs.

**Alpha**: Translate user needs into prototypes. Test prototypes with users and
iterate them based on feedback. We also use the alpha phase to carry out
technical spikes and experiments, and to make initial technology and service
design decisions.

**Beta**: Build a working version of the service, based on what we learnt in
alpha. Carry out regular usability testing of the service with users, and launch
a minimum viable product. Make plans for supporting the service and continue
iterating it.

**Live**: Operate the service, carry out regular user research and continue to
iterate it. If new user needs are identified, we develop the service and launch
new features to meet them.

**Retirement**: Work out how user needs will be met without your service.
Provide help and guidance, archiving, and links to other services. Don't leave
people in the lurch; never let a link die.

We don't always do all these phases for every client. Often, we'll only be
involved in a couple. But we can help with all or any of them, depending on our
clients' needs.

#### Development sprints

We break down projects into two-week sprints. Throughout a project we maintain a
product backlog, refine user stories based on what we learn and carry out
development work to meet the user needs that have been identified.

Every project, client and team is different. But, there are some common
approaches we take to all projects.

On the first day of a sprint we facilitate a planning session and finish sprints
with a show and tell and retrospective. These sessions involve the whole team,
including developers, user researchers, designers and delivery leads, as well as
the product owner and other members of the client team.

##### Communicate Progress

Every morning a delivery lead facilitates a standup. Standups last 5-10 minutes
and are for the team to discuss what they're working on that day and whether
there are any problems or dependencies affecting them. If the team is not
co-located with a client, standups happen over a video-call.

During the sprints a delivery lead will share a week note, usually on a Friday,
with everyone involved or interested in the project. The note will include a
brief summary of what the team have done that week, what is planned for the
following week and highlight blockers, dependencies or things the team is
thinking about too.

At the end of each sprint the team run a show and tell. This is an opportunity
for the team to show the work they have done on that sprint and allows people
involved in the project to see what has been achieved. We work in an open and
transparent way so encourage anyone interested in the project to attend the show
and tell and ask questions.

##### Plan

Sprints begin with a planning session, where the whole team (dxw and the client)
review and prioritise the stories in the backlog. Working together, we discuss
the stories that we are prioritising for the current sprint, ensuring that they
are well-formed and understood by everyone in the team.

Often this involves writing new stories and updating existing ones, but we try
to avoid this becoming the main purpose of the meeting. In our experience,
sprint planning is much more useful when the stories are written in advance.

During this session, developers discuss the effort required to finish each
story. We discuss effort so we know whether we have a reasonable amount of
stories to work on and we’re confident as a team that we can get through the
stories in the backlog. Sometimes we will estimate stories. We do this based on
complexity, not the time we think it will take to finish it.

Once estimated, stories are prioritised by the client and put into the backlog
for the sprint. Developers also advise the rest of the team at this point if
there are any technical dependencies the client should be aware of. By the end
of the session, the full team should be confident about the goal of the sprint
and what is going to be worked on.

##### Inspect and adapt our work

At the end of every sprint, a delivery lead facilitates a retrospective where
the team discuss how the sprint went. We talk about what went well, what didn't,
and what we can do to to improve how we work for the next sprint. These sessions
are attended by all the people involved in delivering the sprint along with the
client team. We use retros to make sure we acknowledge and continue to do the
things that are working well, and also commit to change anything that can be
improved.

##### Focus on user needs

At regular intervals the team look through the sprint backlog to re-prioritise
and update stories, based on things we've learned during delivery and from user
research. Stories that are no longer needed are deleted, stories that may be
needed later or are blocked are put on hold (we call this the icebox) and all
other stories are re-prioritised for future sprints.

We have regular user research playback sessions to ensure the whole team is
involved in understanding user needs, feedback from user testing and what
iterations means for the users.

##### User stories

We document development work that needs to be completed by writing
[user stories](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html).

A user story is a succinct explanation of some work that will be done in order
to meet the needs of a particular kind of user. They are usually structured into
a sentence, of the form:

> As a \[kind of user\], so that I can \[meet a need\], I want \[a feature in
> the product\]

Breaking everything down into user stories allows us to be confident that
everything we develop is meeting
[user needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html).
By using this story format, we directly associate a feature or piece of
functionality we're building with the group of users who want it and the needs
that they have.

We keep lists of stories in Trello. We use user needs to create the title of a
story, by rearranging it to reflect the new state of the system after the work
is complete. For example:

> As an administrator, so that I can ensure I don't publish defamatory comments,
> I want to be able to review and approve comments before they are shown.

Might have a title of:

> Administrators can review and approve comments before they are shown

Each user story will also contain a list of acceptance criteria. Acceptance
criteria are a collection of statements about the functionality of the service
which must be true in order for the story to be considered "done".

For more information about writing good stories, we recommend reading User
Stories Applied by Mike Cohn. There is a copy of this book in the dxw library.

##### Lifecycle of a story

<!-- TODO: This section should be an explanation of what happens to a story as
it is worked on, focussing on "why" rather than "how" and explaining the
philosophy. -->

There are several states that a story has to go through in order to be deployed
to production. We use Trello and physical story boards to keep track of which
stage a given story is in.

- **In progress**: A developer has started working on the story, making changes
  to the product to ensure that each acceptance criterion is met
- **Awaiting review**: The developer has finished the story and is ready for a
  second developer to review the technical aspects of the story in a pull
  request
- **Code review**: The story is being reviewed by the second developer who
  leaves feedback if the pull request is not ready to be merged and needs
  further work
- **dxw/client review**: The two developers have finished the review and the
  story has been merged and pushed to staging. It is ready for a delivery lead
  and the client to review against its acceptance criteria
- **Accepted**: The client has accepted the story and it's ready to deploy to
  production
- **Done**: The story has been deployed to production

#### Managing delivery

> "The delivery manager sets the team up for successful delivery. They remove
> obstacles, or blockers to progress, constantly helping the team become more
> self organising. They enable the work a team does rather than impose how it’s
> done."
> --<cite>[Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/delivery-manager.html)</cite>

At dxw, delivery leads ensure that sprints go smoothly and that the team remain
productive. They are generally the client's first and main point of contact, and
are responsible for ensuring that we deliver good work.

Throughout a sprint, delivery leads ensure that agreed process is followed,
organising and facilitating discussions as required. They run sprint planning
and retrospective sessions. They run daily standups with the dxw and client
teams to keep everyone informed and to discuss and resolve any blockers.

Outside of these sessions and standups, they maintain regular communication with
the client and the delivery team to respond quickly to challenges as they arise.
If priorities change during a sprint, the delivery lead works with the client to
understand and plan for the impact of the change.

### Hosting and supporting services

#### GovPress

GovPress is dxw's hosting platform which hosts the WordPress websites we build
for the public sector.

We built GovPress because our clients were frequently asking us for secure,
scalable and highly available hosting, but didn't have enough budget to be able
to build an appropriate hosting platform for their service. This is fair enough,
because they shouldn't have to. We built GovPress to meet this need, and it is
now used by most of our clients.

We offer
[managed hosting and support](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/930612236449495)
for WordPress websites, as well as
[blogging](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/355674790119695)
and
[campaigns](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/691308552308120)
platforms, through the G-Cloud framework, configured to our client's branding
requirements, all on our GovPress hosting platform.

You can read more about GovPress at
[www.govpress.com](https://www.govpress.com).

#### Tailored support

We also offer support for services that aren't built in WordPress. We are able
to host and support services with our
[tailored support plan for cloud applications](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/393702576050692),
even if your service isn't hosted with us.

#### Support helpdesk

The dxw Technical Operations team build, manage and run GovPress, as well as
provide first-line support.

We use [Zendesk](https://dxw.zendesk.com) to manage support requests. Any
incidents, requests for us to fix a problem or make a change to a site must come
to us via Zendesk as a ticket. We use tickets to manage requests in order to:

- Keep track of all the things we need to do, and what state they're in, for us
  and our clients
- Have a record of the changes we're asked to make
- Ensure that we only accept change requests from people who are authorised
- Generate data about how much staff time is spent on each client's issues.

If a client asks us to do something in person, on the phone or via email, we ask
them to visit the [dxw Zendesk](https://dxw.zendesk.com/), and submit a ticket
there. This is so that:

- We can keep track of the issue from report to solution, and ensure that it's
  assigned to the right person;
- We don't risk misunderstanding the problem by writing it down based on a
  verbal explanation
- We can formally track the changes that people ask for, by documenting them in
  tickets that we can look at later if we need to

For these reasons, we do not do any work on a client website or service unless
we are working during scheduled development time or on a relevant ticket. We
think this is really important.

##### Support rota

We work on tickets by having a developer on support according to a rota.
Developers are assigned to support for one week at a time and work on tickets
for the whole week. If there is a ticket they need another developer to help
with, this work is scheduled.

#### Client experience (AKA: ticket principles)

##### Be responsive

Clients expect us to deal with their issues promptly. But they understand that
this isn't always possible. They are generally forgiving of the fact that we're
sometimes busy, and they understand that some issues are complex and require
long investigations.

The thing most clients value above all else is being kept informed of what is
going on. The first quality of a good ticket experience is responsiveness: we
keep clients informed of what we're doing, even if there hasn't been much
progress.

##### Stick to your commitments

It's really important that we do what we say we'll do, and don't promise things
we can't deliver. If we're unable to deal with a ticket in good time and leave
an update saying we'll work on it tomorrow, we must meet that commitment.

It is doubly bad to fail to meet a commitment and not say anything about it.
Responsiveness is always the priority. So if for some reason we couldn't do what
we said we'd do, we always respond to say so.

##### Make a good impression

In tickets as in all things, we are mindful of dxw's [values](#our-values).

Most clients' routine contact with us is via support tickets, so it's vital that
our clients' experience of the support system is a good one, and also that they
have a positive experience with us personally.

We are always considerate, and think about what style of response is best. For
example, technical clients may appreciate short, information-dense responses,
while non-technical clients might perceive that style as rude or dismissive.

In general:

- We are personable, friendly and helpful
- If things look like they're going to get difficult or the client seems
  unhappy, we are honest and assume good faith
- If we screw something up, we take responsibility and apologise. If the client
  seems very upset, we let a delivery lead know.
- If we do become annoyed or frustrated by a ticket, we respond later or speak
  to a delivery lead about reassigning it.

##### Don't over-deliver

Of course, every client would like us to go the extra mile to solve their
problem. But they also understand that to do that for them would mean bad
service for another client - or that we never get to their issue, because we're
too busy gold-plating the solution to someone else's.

While we do everything we can to make sure the client is happy with our
solution, we are also mindful of what's practical. We don't do serious bits of
development work on tickets, or trial new approaches. We don't play with new
tools or sink hours into interesting bugs. We set those things aside, and do
them later.

The main purpose of a ticket is to take some action that solves the problem, as
quickly as possible. Generally speaking, we do the most time-efficient thing
that we can. Of several potential solutions that solve the problem, assuming
none is a bad one, we do the one which can be implemented the most quickly.

#### Deciding what to work on

Developers on support are free to work on whichever tickets they are assigned to
and think is most important. But there are some important things to bear in
mind.

##### Triage

We all have limited time. We try to spend it wisely. All other things being
equal, it is better to spend half an hour solving each of four tickets than to
spend two hours on one issue.

##### Priority

The priority of tickets is important, and we must be biased towards dealing with
more urgent tickets before less urgent ones.

Each ticket's priority should be reviewed regularly: whenever we update a
ticket, we check the priority to make sure it's still right.

#### Initial investigation

It's important that we don't make changes unless we thoroughly understand what
we're being asked to do, and are confident that the client understands and has
approved of the implications of the change.

##### Replicate the bug

If the issue is a bug, we replicate the behaviour the client has reported before
working on a fix. It's important that we can reliably and repeatably create the
conditions necessary for the bug to arise before we start working on it. If we
don't do this, we can't tell whether we've fixed the problem.

##### Ensure the client has understood and approved the change

When presented with a problem, clients don't always ask us to do the most
appropriate thing to fix it. Sometimes we can think of a better solution.
Sometimes the change the client asks for has some implication that they haven't
considered.

Our helpdesk service is advisory, so we're not afraid to suggest alternative
approaches and ideas if we have them - including where there's a better
solution, but [at a cost](#charging-for-ticket-work). We always give options
when we can.

#### Scope

Clients can use the support service to ask for help with any aspect of the
service we provide, including help with using the admin panel and advice on
getting the best out of their site.

But there are some limitations. Under the support service, we do not:

- Add any new functionality requiring anything beyond extremely trivial
  development. This does not generally include installing plugins: checking and
  installing plugins is allowed
- Alter the source code of a plugin or library maintained by a third party
- Do things that the client can do for themselves in the WordPress
  administration area. In this situation, help them by letting them know the
  steps to take to achieve whatever they're trying to do.
- Other than by prior arrangement, communicate on the client's behalf with the
  operators of third-party services that the site uses
- Install a plugin that fails an inspection
- Do research to identify plugins to solve a particular problem. It's fine to
  recommend something that we already know of, but in this situation, we usually
  ask the client to do some searches on the WordPress Directory and suggest one,
  which we can then check and install.
- Fix complex problems that come up after a plugin or WordPress core update is
  applied. Exactly what constitutes a complex problem is at our discretion. But
  if we've spent a couple of hours on an update-related bug and it's still not
  fixed, we're probably dealing with one.
- From time to time, we may make an exception to these restrictions. If you
  think that might be appropriate, ask a delivery lead. In all the above cases,
  we can offer to quote for the required work.

#### Charging for ticket work

If you decide that a ticket asks for work to be done which falls outside this
scope, then the work is chargeable. In this situation, we reassign the ticket to
a delivery lead or someone from the client services team with an explanation.

It is good to try to think of alternative approaches that we could do under our
support service before taking this step - seek advice if you're unsure.

The person you assign the ticket to will then treat it as a [lead](#sales), and
contact the client to make a plan.

### Sharing our expertise

#### Attending events

We all go to work-related events and conferences, sometimes for work and
sometimes in our personal time. No matter what capacity you’re attending an
event in, you are a representative of dxw. What you say and do will influence
the way people think about the company. It’s important that you make a positive
impression.

We encourage everyone to network and talk about dxw’s work. Remember to tell
people if we’re hiring and point them to our careers page on the dxw website.

#### Speaking at events

Speaking at events is a great opportunity to represent dxw.

If it’s an event around your personal speciality (front-end development, sysops,
UX etc), feel free to stick to any personal “branding”, slide format, or talk
style you might have already developed. At the start of your talk however,
please introduce yourself as being from dxw, talk about what the company does,
and what you do here.

If it’s an event more around dxw’s focus (public sector events, dxw projects,
public-sector specific topic etc) you should use dxw’s branding and slides.
Introduce the company in full and what your role is.

It takes time to prepare talks that work well. If you need help or advice please
ask for it in the #dxw-marketing channel on Slack.

It’s also good to blog after the event, to share the content or to talk about
your experience and what you learned.

If you need time to be set aside to prepare or follow up a talk, talk to your
delivery lead and see what’s possible.

#### Our blog

At dxw, we encourage people to blog regularly.

We blog because we want to share what we’re doing and what we’re learning with
the public sector digital community. We work in the open and are keen to share
our knowledge, express our values and get people thinking about how to improve
services for the public sector.

When we’re hiring, we also want potential new staff to be able to to get to know
us beforehand.

We record ideas for blog posts and the schedule for publishing on a Trello
board. This is managed by the marketing team, who can offer you help and advice
on ideas and support with writing if you need it. They will also manage the
final sign off and publishing of posts. Get in touch through the #dxw-marketing
channel on Slack.

#### Twitter

The marketing team run dxw’s official Twitter account.

We encourage people to work openly and to tweet about the work they’re doing,
their learning and ideas from their own accounts. You should be careful not to
share any confidential information and check that people are content before
using any pictures of them. Remember that you are representing dxw whether or
not you identify yourself as working here in your Twitter profile.
