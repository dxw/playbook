### Supporting your development and wellbeing

#### People manager and HR surgeries

The bi-weekly HR surgeries are there to give an opportunity for members of the
team to discuss matters they might not feel able to raise with buddies/delivery
leads/line managers or that are specialist to the HR function in dxw.

The list is not exhaustive but some topics might include:

- Holiday
- Sickness
- Pay
- Expenses
- Parental Leave
- Accessibility
- Probation
- Pensions
- Occupational health issues
- Contractual matters
- Working patterns/locations
- Training and career progression
- Diversity
- Inclusivity
- Stress management
- Interpersonal issues
- Bereavement
- Grievance and disciplinary matters
- Facilitation/scheduling of conversations with Directors/heads-of, such as
  Salary Reviews

Bookable slots are available on Wednesdays and Fridays at 11am but the People
Manager’s door is always open.

#### Line managers

Line management at dxw is not about hierarchy, it’s about providing professional
guidance and support.

Line managers ensure that team members are clear about their roles and
responsibilities at dxw, and how well they are doing at achieving them.

Individuals should be proactive in taking responsibility for their own
development, but line managers will provide advice and support to help team
members meet their agreed short and long term goals.

HR support line managers with advice and guidance on recruitment, onboarding,
probation, performance, sickness and any other specialist knowledge.

You can find out who your line manager is in BreatheHR on the summary section of
your profile page.

##### Line management principles

###### Communicate clearly

Communication is a two-way process and it is important to check understanding
and confidence, and value the other person in decision-making. Explaining the
task and its objectives clearly means people know what’s expected of them and
the part they play. It empowers them to take responsibility and own how they
approach the work.

###### Recognise achievement and celebrate success

A simple ‘thank you’ shows someone that what they have done is appreciated, and
is hugely motivating. Celebrating major, and minor, achievements is an important
part of our culture at dxw. It builds team spirit and morale.

###### Guard our values

Lead by example. The actions and behaviours of line managers must always
demonstrate our dxw values. We should always hold ourselves accountable to our
values, and encourage the same in all of our colleagues, including those we line
manage.

###### Continuous constructive feedback

Find out how each of your team members prefers to receive feedback, and develop
an approach which reflects that. Ongoing positive and constructive feedback is
essential if someone is to feel valued, learn from their experiences and become
better at what they do.

###### Be honest

Being honest means telling the truth and being consistent in what you say and
who you say it to. Telling things as they are, while being sensitive to the
situation and individual, ensures that people know where they stand and will
help to build mutual trust and respect.

###### Wellbeing

Line managers look out for the health and wellbeing of the team. They are
responsible for carrying out dxw's duty of care to its people.

#### One-to-ones with your line manager

##### Purpose

For your manager to help you with your personal and professional development,
your wellbeing, and to build a trusting relationship between the two of you.

##### Overview

These meetings are about you; ideally you will feel happy driving the meeting.
If you’re not confident doing this, or are unsure how best to approach it, your
manager will help you to get there.

##### Agenda and topics

Coming to your 1:1s with a list of things you’d like to discuss will help you
make the most of the time. Some things you might find productive to talk about
include:

- **Your career and growth goals:** Don’t assume your manager knows all your
  aspirations. Bring them up in your 1:1s. Your manager understands you won’t
  work for them forever and they want you to have a happy, fulfilling career —
  whatever that means to you. Tip: if you want to talk about your long-term
  goals but feel uneasy about it, ask your manager to do the same.
- **Team improvement:** Have an idea that will help your team to work better?
  Use your manager as a sounding board to help you refine and implement your
  suggestion.
- **Self improvement:** Got a specific thing you’d like some help, coaching or
  feedback on? A technical skill or a soft skill? Your 1:1 is the place to bring
  it up. Remember that you can use the 1:1s that fall between career progression
  reviews to discuss any of the proficiencies you’re currently trying to level
  up on.
- **Personal issues:** Anything going on outside of work that’s affecting your
  wellbeing? Physical or mental illness, bereavement, family issues, stress? The
  more you can tell your manager, the more they can try to help, and make
  accommodations for you at work.
- **Interpersonal issues:** Having problems with a coworker? Your manager can
  help mediate or coach you through how to deal with the issue.
- **Retrospection:** If at any time you feel like your 1:1s aren’t particularly
  productive or helpful, or you’d like to change something about them, don’t
  hesitate to bring this up with your manager.

##### Frequency

1:1s should happen at least once per fortnight. Where possible they’ll be
face-to-face, either in the office or out for a walk, or a coffee. Where that’s
not possible, remote is perfectly fine. There’ll always be a Google Meet link in
the calendar invite.

If you need to reschedule your 1:1, let your manager know at the earliest
opportunity.

##### Meeting length

An hour or so, at least once every two weeks, is a good standard to aim for. If
you meet weekly, a little shorter is fine.

#### Learning and Development

Everybody at dxw gets a yearly learning and development allowance of £1,000 and
up to 4 days.

Read the [Learning and Development guide](/guides/learning-and-development) to
find out more.

Read the [line managers guide](/guides/line-management-guides) to learn about
how to support Learning and Development for your team members.

#### Private Slack channels

We encourage everyone at dxw to be open about their identities and the
challenges they experience at work, but sometimes we want to only talk to people
whose experiences more closely resemble our own. To enable that, we have created
a number of private channels:

- #identity-lgbtqia-plus (contact a member of @identity-lgbtqia-plus-admins to
  join)
- #identity-gender-minority (contact a member of
  @identity-gender-minority-admins to join)

Anyone can create a new one by creating the private channel, creating a user
group with at least one volunteer (or asking a Slack admin to do it for you),
and adding it to this list. It's probably a good idea to share that you've
created it in #general.

The membership of those channels is also private to protect those people, and
members of a channel are expected to keep everything in those channels private.

We don't police membership of these channels, and trust everyone to be honest
about their identities. **Don't invite anyone without first asking them if they
want to be invited.**

#### Book purchase

If there is a book relevant to your work that you would like to read, make a
request through the #help-purchasing slack channel and the Bus Ops team will buy
it for the library.

#### Cycle to work scheme

dxw operates a cycle-to-work scheme, which may allow you to purchase a bicycle
at reduced cost. If you would like to take this up, please register
[on the cycle scheme website](https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/18eb71)

#### Eyecare vouchers

dxw provides eyecare for the team via a voucher system run by ASE Corporate
Eyecare Ltd and Boots.

Details of what the wellbeing voucher offers can be found here:
[Eyecare for Wellbeing](https://www.eyecareplans.co.uk/corporate-eyecare/eyecare-for-wellbeing/).

#### Backpack and other personal equipment

dxw will pay for the equipment needed to enable you to work comfortably and
safely. dxw also offers a budget of £25 towards a work backpack. Use the
help-purchasing Slack channel to request any equipment you need, or talk to
anyone in business operations if you are unsure if a purchase will be covered.

#### Support paths

##### Helpers

When you join dxw you will be assigned a helper. This person will work closely
with you for at least your first 4 months. They will do a similar job to you,
help you meet members of the wider team, catch up with you on at least a 3/6/12
week basis to ensure you are receiving everything you need, and will NEVER get
bored of your questions!

If you feel that you’re not getting as much time with your helper as you’d like,
please speak to the People Manager.

As a helper, you will be vital in ensuring you have the regular catch ups - if
you are finding it hard to schedule them, please do talk to Bus Ops.

For more information on being a helper, please see the
[checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dc3IRZ_ze7QzMQTHO70ZC6hU8cig5ds7LN2MoHmPBe8/edit)
or speak to the People Manager.

##### Buddies

Once you have passed your 4 month probation, we would like you to choose a buddy
within the company to support you.

We recommend this person **doesn’t** work directly with you, someone in a
different role and that you don’t work closely with on projects, as this will
give you a second pair of ears and a whole new set of experiences to draw on.

This is not mandatory, just recommended and similarly not everyone may wish to
be a buddy - don’t be afraid to ask or say no. It can be reciprocal but doesn’t
have to be. Also, if you feel that a change of buddy would benefit you for
whatever reason or that you’re no longer able to be a buddy, this should also
not be an awkward situation. If you have any concerns, have a chat with the
People Manager.

The buddy system is there to help us all improve, to make sure we're doing the
right kind of work and to check that we're dealing with practical problems we're
facing. It's not line management, so it's not the right place to talk about
holiday, salary, sickness, absence or anything disciplinary. If you need to talk
about those things, talk to the People Manager.

If you want to know more about how the buddy system works, how often to meet and
suggested discussion topics, see the buddy
[crib sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBKwPLFsGWUUzeYAObcFLQJyTPknkLhm2HrbuHwxelU/edit?usp=sharing).
This shouldn’t be a huge time commitment, ideally just a pleasant Friday meet
up.

##### Your delivery lead (for those on client work)

There will be opportunities within the delivery team to raise any issues or
concerns you might have e.g. retrospectives or planning sessions. As well as
this, or if you’d prefer to talk one on one, the delivery lead working on the
project will be available to provide support and guidance.

##### Directors and heads-of

All members of the Directors and heads-of team are here to help answer any
questions you might have. Your own Director and/or Head-of profession or
location is there to provide support on matters relating to dxw and your career
with us, as well as profession specific questions. Similarly, they are here if
you need to escalate any job-related concerns.

##### Our Managing Director, Dave

At dxw, all doors are open if you need to raise a concern or just have a chat -
this includes our MD. Dave is always available to discuss any questions you have
about the company and its future. Equally, if you feel you need to escalate
anything to him, don’t hesitate to get in touch. Dave's diary is open and you
can see it on Google Calendar. If you would like to schedule some time with him,
please feel free to book something.
