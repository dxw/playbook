### Managing your day to day work

#### Working hours

Our working hours are 10:00-18:00, Monday to Friday. Some people work different
hours by arrangement. Anyone is free to do that as long as their hours of work
don't make it hard for other people to get things done. For example, many people
arrive earlier than 10:00 and leave earlier, which is generally fine.

Each team has a short standup every morning, where we each tell the whole team
about a single thing we will get done that day. If you think you're going to be
late, you should let everyone know in the project Slack channel.

Most developers have maintenance responsibilities, which they do during their
[support rotation](#support-rota).

We do our very best to
[work at a sustainable pace](#work-at-a-sustainable-pace). But sometimes, when
we're approaching a firm deadline or a launch, or a client is having an
emergency, we work longer hours than normal. From time to time, there's an
emergency that means we have to work during unsociable hours to solve the
problem. Neither of these happen very often, but they are a normal part of life
at dxw.

Sending emails or posting in Slack outside of working hours can be a good way to
get things off your mind, but it can create an unintended sense of urgency for
the people who receive your message. Try to avoid creating that urgency when
it’s not necessary. For example, by specifically saying that you don’t expect an
immediate response.

Unless they are actually urgent, you can ignore messages you receive outside of
working hours and handle them when you are back at work.

#### Working days

##### Monday to Thursday

**Client facing**: We charge clients “time and materials” for the work we do,
based on a
[per person day rate](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-10/documents/92768/432689933684667-sfia-rate-card-2018-05-23-1413.pdf).
We generally schedule team members to work on particular projects for a whole
sprint at a time, and track and bill that time in half days and whole days.
Delivery leads work with the finance team to track and invoice the time of the
team; having regularly patterned working helps the process to run as smoothly as
possible, without confusion and without taking more time than needed. Any
working arrangement needs to make it straightforward to track, report and
invoice for your time.

When working on a project we work as a single multi-disciplinary team. We’re
often working on phases of projects where there’s a lot of unknowns and a lot of
learning, so we use agile approaches and strongly favour being able to work
together on problems. That’s often easier when co-located, particularly when
working with clients, pairing, or participating in workshops. Any working
arrangement needs to support active synchronous collaboration with the team.

**Internal facing**: Internal facing roles, in which time is not billable to a
client, have a more regularly structured five day working week. Everybody is
encouraged to take part in Friday work, at least occasionally.

##### dxw days

We regularly come back together as a team to work on our own projects and
processes, normally each Friday. These dxw days are important for us to maintain
our strong culture and identity, separate from the clients we work for. Our
sprints start on a Wednesday and end on the Tuesday two weeks later.

#### Working from home

Generally, we work either at our office or at client sites. But it's usually
fine to work from home from time to time, or in order to complete a specific
task. If you're working apart from your team, it is essential that you remain
contactable and productive, and the onus is on you to be especially
communicative.

#### Reporting your time

Everyone who works on a client project at dxw is responsible for reporting the
time they spend on projects. We usually work with our clients on a
[time and materials basis](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-pay-for-digital-outcomes-and-specialists-services#time-and-materials),
so it’s important we can accurately track and report how our time is spent on
client projects.

We use [10,000ft](https://app.10000ft.com/) to schedule our work, which helps us
to forecast our capacity over future weeks and months in a reliable way.

We track our time at the same level of granularity that we bill it – for almost
everyone in the team, that’s half days or whole days.

##### What to do when reporting your time

When reporting our time, we follow these guidelines:

- If what was scheduled matches reality, simply confirm this time.
- If you worked on a named project (client or internal including "dxw Support"),
  that differs from the schedule, record your time as that.
- If you worked on something else, leave the time blank or zero out what you
  were scheduled to work on.
- If you were away on planned leave, confirm your time as "Out of office".
- If you were off sick, record your time as "Sick".
- If you had unplanned leave, record your time as "Out of office".
- If you were away due to a regular day off, as part of your working pattern,
  leave the time blank or zero out what you were scheduled to work on.

If you’re not doing client work, then unless you’re working on one of a handful
of named internal projects or support, you don’t need to record your time
against any other piece of work – the assumption is you’re doing valuable work,
whether it’s learning, helping with recruitment or improving our tooling and
processes, and we don’t need itemised time tracking to justify that.

We’ve set up the platform, so that it understands individual team members’
working patterns. This means the team don’t need to worry about entering in
their non working days.

Our delivery leads lend a helping hand when delivery team members aren’t sure
how to record their time – they’ve been doing this for a long while and have a
well developed sense for it.

#### Getting things you need

Anytime you need to order something, notice a problem in the office (e.g. a
broken chair or dripping tap) or you need some help with your laptop or the
printer - there is a Slack channel for it. If in doubt, please speak to the
Commercial Operations team and they’ll point you in the right direction.

#### Claiming expenses

From time to time, some of us spend our own money at work. Most often, this is
things like:

- Train fares for unexpected travel
- Refreshments purchased for meetings with clients
- Stationery/materials, especially for workshops or events

dxw will always pay expenses which are:

- **Necessary**: We only expense things we need in order to be able to complete
  our work
- **Proportionate**: The total expense should be proportionate to the work at
  hand. In general, we try to avoid spending lots of money. For example, unless
  you have a good reason, don't get a cab to a meeting when you could get a
  train.

Wherever possible, it's best to check that expenses can be reclaimed before
incurring them.

We manage expenses using Xero. For more information about how to do this, see
the [guide on claiming expenses](/guides/claiming-expenses)

#### Calendars and documents

We use Google Apps for Work to manage calendars, write and share documents.
There is a dxw folder where we share most of the things we write. If you can't
see it when you log in to Google Drive, you'll need to ask someone else to send
you the link, and then click "Add to drive".

When we write new things, we try to save them in a sensible folder within the
existing structure.

#### Internal tech support

If you experience problems with the office printers, wi-fi, video conference
set-up, Macs etc… You may send a message in the **#help-techsupport** Slack
channel.

#### Using a personal device at work

Most of us use at least one personal device as part of our work, because it's
more convenient than carrying lots of devices around. However, no one is
obligated to use a personal device for work. If you need a dxw-provided phone,
tablet or other device, please ask for one.

Anyone who does use a personal device must take reasonable care to ensure that
it cannot compromise dxw's security. This includes implementing prudent security
measures, being mindful that your personal devices could be targeted as part of
an attack on dxw or its clients. For example, you might receive an email to your
personal email address designed to trick you into revealing a work-related
password.

Exactly what security measures are prudent may vary depending on the device and
what you're using it for. Some good practice examples are:

- Configuring screens to lock after a period of inactivity
- Ensuring that work-related data on the device is regularly backed up
- Encrypting storage
- Using good passwords and changing defaults
- Avoiding connecting devices to untrustworthy networks (internet cafes,
  security conferences, unencrypted (open) wifi networks, etc)
- Disposing of your device securely when you no longer need it

If you need to use a personal device but cannot take these sorts of measures,
you should get permission first.

#### Report a lost or stolen device used for work

Submit an urgent ticket by sending an email to support-emergency@dxw.com stating
which work device was lost or stolen and when the incident had occurred.

Our support staff will be immediately notified, at any time of day.

#### Data protection

Though dxw doesn't control much personal data, our clients generally do. And
some of it may be held on sites that we host. Everyone at dxw has a
responsibility to keep that data safe, and process it in accordance with the
[data protection principles](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act).

In particular, we:

- Only process personal data as part of work on the service that we're
  contracted to provide to a client
- Don't access personal data unless we need to in order to do our jobs: don't
  read people's personal data or private communications without good reason
- We do not ever disclose people's personal data to anyone outside dxw unless
  specifically instructed, and are satisfied that it is legal to do so

If you have any questions about data protection, talk to the Data Protection
Officer, Gurps.

#### Protective marking scheme

Some information that we have is confidential. We use a protective marking
scheme so that everyone understands how to handle this material, and who they're
allowed to disclose it to. All of the documents and data we hold will fall into
one of the categories below.

- **Management-in-Confidence**: internal documents whose circulation within dxw
  needs to be restricted.
- **Company Confidential**: information owned by dxw which would be of value to
  those outside the company, such as competitors, and whose loss or theft would
  potentially damage the company.
- **Client Confidential** or **Commercial in Confidence**: information owned by
  dxw or its clients, which needs to remain confidential between dxw and the
  client.
- **Unclassified**: information, which would not be of significant commercial
  value to those outside dxw.

Some of our clients also have protective marking schemes. For example, all
central government bodies will apply the
[Government Protective Marking System (GPMS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications).
If you are in possession of materials that are protectively marked using other
schemes, treat them as company confidential.

We take care to handle all data carefully, but when information is protectively
marked, extra requirements apply.

Because we value openness highly, we take care not to over-classify information.
We don't protectively mark information unless there is a good reason to keep it
confidential.

##### Management-in-confidence

This category is used only for dxw's most confidential information. For example,
employment records, salary details and company strategy documents.

Do not share any information with this marking with any person, whether internal
or external to dxw.

This information:

- Must be clearly labelled or described as "Management-in-confidence"
- When printed
  - Stored only in a locked container
  - Transported only via courier, recorded delivery or personally by dxw staff
  - Destroyed by cross-cut shredding when no longer required
- When digital
  - Stored in an encrypted format
  - Communicated only when encrypted or via an encrypted connection, unless
    emailed from one dxw.com address to another

##### Company Confidential

This category is used for information which should not be communicated outside
dxw. For example, details about how we operate security controls or internal
discussions about client work.

Exactly the same controls apply to this information as detailed under
Management-in-confidence, with the exception that Company Confidential
information can be shared within dxw as required.

##### Client Confidential or Commercial in Confidence

This category is used for information which is disclosed to a limited group of
people external to dxw, or which is unclassified information we have received
from clients. For example, dxw proposals, presentations for pitches or planning
documents.

Unless otherwise specified, all unclassified information we receive from clients
falls into this category.

This information:

- Must be clearly labelled or described as "Client Confidential" or "Commercial
  in Confidence"
- When printed:
  - Stored out of sight
  - Destroyed by cross-cut shredding when no longer required
- When digital:
  - Stored in an encrypted format when on exchangeable media or a mobile device

As a rule of thumb, label a document as Client Confidential if it mostly
contains the client's confidential information, or Commercial in Confidence if
it mostly contains dxw's.

##### Unclassified

Anything not captured by the sections above is unclassified. Examples are
external marketing material, general emails and letters.

Beyond a general duty to treat information carefully, unclassified information
is not subject to any specific restrictions.

#### Email autoresponder

If you require an out of office message on your email account please send your
request to support@dxw.com with the subject title **Email Autoresponder** which
must include start date, the contact details for another member of the team for
any urgent queries, and return date to be added to our mail server.
