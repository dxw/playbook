### Hiring new people

#### Basics

We use [Workable](https://dxw.workable.com) for recruitment, to help us stay
organised and keep in touch with candidates.

Each candidate moves through a number of stages before being offered a job or
declined: a screening interview via Skype or phone, an interview and a work day.
The work day includes another interview.

We feel strongly that it's important to be respectful of candidates' time and
interest in us, and that their attention is valuable. So we do our best to be
responsive, human and open. It's particularly important to give unsuccessful
candidates good, thorough feedback about why we haven't made them an offer.

#### Job descriptions

Before we decide to advertise a new job, we write a job description. This helps
us make sure we all agree on what we need, and helps candidates to know if their
skills are a good fit for the job. A good job description has three parts:

1. A description of what the person in this job will do
1. A list of their responsibilities
1. A list of the skills, experience and personal qualities they will need to be
   good at their job

There are lots of job descriptions on the website if you need inspiration. It's
important for them to be declarative ("The person with this job will...") and as
objective as possible. Throughout the rest of the process, we'll use this
document to decide what questions to ask in interviews, and to fix activities
for the work day. The skills and personal qualities need to be things that we
can have a go at understanding by asking questions and observing a candidate's
behaviour.

#### How we find people

The first way we find people is through our networks. We look for people we
know. Everyone who is willing tweets about the job and shares it on Facebook and
other social networks.

The second way we find people is by advertising. We advertise jobs on
Stack Overflow, GitHub, WorkInStartups and Unicorn Hunt. Not all jobs go on all
of these boards - we pick whatever seems most appropriate for the job.

The third way we find people is by making sure we're regularly blogging about
what we're doing, and being open about our culture, work and process. We accept
[general applications](https://www.dxw.com/careers/general-application/) from
people who are interested in dxw but who don't fit an open job.

#### Review applications

All applications arrive via Workable. We review these applications as a team to
decide who to take forward.

An application review is a very quick process. We look at the information given
by the candidate and decide if it is likely that the applicant has the skills,
experience and personal qualities that we need. If it is likely, we progress
them to the next stage.

#### Screening

The purpose of the screening is to:

1. Introduce ourselves and explain a little more about the job and life at dxw
1. Talk to the candidate about their experience and explore why they are
   interested in the job
1. Decide whether you think they are quite likely to have the experience and
   personal qualities that we are looking for
1. Get an idea of the candidate's
   salary expectation

Try to keep the conversation quite high-level, and avoid going into too much
technical detail. This part of the process is more about experience and personal
qualities than about skills. So look for whether this person:

* has an interest in our [mission](#who-we-are)
* shares our [values](#our-values)
* has experience working in [human-centred](#start-with-people-and-their-needs) and [agile](#keep-an-agile-mindset) ways

If you can find out how they heard about the job, that's useful for us to know.

Many people feel self-conscious when asking questions about salary, but it's
very important - and this is one of the few situations in daily life where
people expect the question and are not put off by it. If you're not sure how to
broach the topic, leave it to the end. When you're about to finish the call, you
can say something like:

"Thanks for talking to me. Before we finish, please could you give me an idea
of the salary you'd like?"

If the candidate suggests a number that is unexpectedly high or low, it's also
worth asking what they are paid in their current role.

We avoid making any commitments during this call. Near the end, we explain that
we'll be in touch soon. Don't offer an interview there and then: that's
something we agree as a team.

After the call, you can talk about the candidate with the team if you wish, or
just make a decision. If you think it's quite likely that they have the skills,
experience and personal qualities that we need, you should take them through to
an interview.

#### Interviews

Candidates who have a successful screen will be offered an interview. This is an
hour long with two members of the team.

Before going to an interview, make sure you have:

* Set aside enough time for the interview. You should leave half an hour each
  side in case the candidate is early or the interview goes long.
* Read the job description
* Read the candidate's CV
* Read the questions for the interview, and thought about whether they are the
  right things to ask

dxw interviews are informal. They are a semi-structured conversation, rather
than a Q&A. We do not recite the list of questions or keep verbose notes on
replies. The questions are there to ensure that you don't forget to cover
important ground, and as a prompt when the conversation naturally dries up.

Start with a couple of questions, and then allow the conversation to evolve
naturally. Ask questions about things they say, and try to go into more detail
on the points that you think will help you to assess their skills, experience
and personal qualities. Keep the job description in mind: this should always be
your frame of reference.

At the end of the interview, always ask the candidate if there's anything they
would like to ask you. If they have questions, answer them honestly. If they ask
about salary at this stage, or have a concern or question about the job that you
don't feel comfortable addressing, tell the candidate we'll get back to them and
make a note for an appropriate colleague to call them.

When everything's done, we thank the candidate for their time and then return to
the office and discuss the interview. As soon as possible, we put a thorough
update on Workable. This update should include the good things and bad things
about the candidate, a recommendation on whether to take them forward, and a
rationale for that recommendation. It is very important that this update is
detailed enough for us to understand what happened and why, long after everyone
involved has forgotten all about it.

If you think the candidate is very likely to have the skills, experience and
personal qualities we need, you should take them through to a work day.

The work day interview is exactly the same as the first interview, but with
different members of the team and different questions. Usually, it happens in
the first hour of the work day.

#### Work day

TODO. This section to cover:

* Principles for a good work day
* Preparing a work day activity
* Letting the candidate know if they need to bring anything and how much time
  we'll need
* Making sure there is a printed or emailed explanation for what they need to do
* Discussing the results
* Offer if we are sure they are right

#### Offer, joining and probation

TODO. This section to cover:

* Salary negotiation, notice periods and start date
* Eligibility to work in the UK, documentation that we need
* Background check
* Starters checklist
* The probation period, meeting and expectations
* ...more things.

#### Returners' programme

dxw is proud to offer return to work opportunities for experienced hires who are looking to re-enter the workplace after an extended period of time away.

We’re running a pilot to begin with to see how this works for us and the people joining us. We’ll start by taking on one or two people for 3 to 6 months - depending on the role and circumstances. There’s potential to become a permanent member of the team at the end of the placement, but this isn’t guaranteed.

Initially this opportunity will only be offered within our London team, with a view to including our Leeds office as the team there grows.

##### Who supports you?

You will be supported by our people team from the point of application.

If you’re invited into our recruitment process, it will consist of a one hour interview followed by a collaborative activity with the team which will be sent to you 24 hours in advance so you have time to prepare.

The interview will be an informal, semi-structured conversation where there will be the opportunity for us to learn more about you and your experience and, just as importantly, for you to get a feel for what it’s like to work at dxw.

If you join us, you’ll be continuously supported by our people team, a line manager and a mentor within the same field. You‘ll have regular check ins with the team where you can speak openly about anything that’s on your mind.

##### Client facing role

For client-facing roles we’ll start billing your time back to the client when we feel the time is right. This will be something we discuss openly during the recruitment process and through your regular check ins.

#### Internal facing roles

We’re also offering internal facing roles, for example, in our busy commercial and marketing teams who also support our sister company, Tradecraft. These roles are not billed back to our clients.

If you think this might be for you, please apply through our jobs page.
