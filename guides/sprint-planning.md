title: Sprint Planning

## What is it?

Sprint planning meetings take place at the start of every sprint. They are used
by the team to agree what work to deliver for that given sprint.

They are an opportunity to reflect on the project’s goals and roadmap, and to
prioritise the most valuable work that pushes the project forward. They should
give the team clarity about what they need to focus on and why. They can help
build consensus about the direction the team and project are going in. They
typically last about an hour.

## Who should be invited?

Sprint planning should involve everyone in the delivery team - this should
usually include dxw and the client teams together. This is important as it helps
establish a close working team with a shared understanding of what’s important.

## Preparation

A well run sprint planning session takes some preparation. Investing the time up
front will help your team be clear on what they need to focus on.

- **Think about the priorities for the sprint.** Review your project’s goals and
  roadmap - what is the most important thing you need to do?
- **Speak to members of the team.** Get input from the product manager, the tech
  lead and others to get their thoughts on what’s important.
- **Clean up the backlog.** Update tickets from the previous sprint as best as
  you can, and make sure things are in the right columns. Make it clear what the
  priority tickets are for this sprint, for example by putting them to the top
  of your backlog.

## During the meeting

Have a facilitator for the meeting - usually the product manager or delivery
lead. As a team:

- Review the project board from right to left, to see what’s been shipped in the
  last sprint and to see what’s still in progress
- Review the backlog in priority order (i.e. top to bottom). For each ticket go
  through the title and description.
  - If the ticket isn’t clear then reword it so that everyone understands what’s
    required.
  - Assign it to a person or discipline in the team
- Break down bigger tickets into smaller ones if needed
- Identify dependencies (dependency label where something is going to be
  blocked)
- Gauge as team whether the work is realistic and achievable; revisit what
  you’re committing to until it does.
- Identify opportunities for pairing/ knowledge transfer

Once you have a prioritised set of work for the sprint that the team are happy
with, people should refer back to this on a daily basis to pick up work. You can
use it in daily standups to track progess. If you get a sense that the scope is
creeping or the team doesn’t have the skills or the size you need, then do
something to address this.

## Project boards and tickets

We typically use [Trello](https://trello.com) to create project/product
roadmaps, as well as sprint boards. Clients occasionally have other similar
services in place, such as [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).

Creating tickets in the right way helps the team be clear on what they need to
do. Below are some tips for writing good tickets.

- Have one ‘thing’ per card, and make it the smallest possible thing. This helps
  create a sense of momentum.
- Identify dependencies - including things that the ticket impacts, as well as
  things that it will rely on
- Write the ticket in a way that helps someone in the team pick it up and work
  on it
- Connect the ticket back to a need - e.g. a user need or a project goal. Is it
  clear why this work is important? How will you know it’s done the job it needs
  to?

Generally, try to avoid:

- Getting into the weeds on how the ticket will be implemented
- Planning too far ahead - keep the length of the project in mind, but in sprint
  planning focus primarily on the next fortnight
- Getting into retrospective territory
