title: Running a discovery kick-off workshop
---

This guide explains how we run a kick-off workshop for a discovery project at
dxw digital.

For an alpha or beta, or for a significant update to a live service, we run a
[roadmapping workshop](/guides/running-a-roadmapping-workshop).

For discovery focussed projects it can be less clear what the end result will
be, and whether we’re looking at a single service or cutting across several. So
we use a broader set of questions.

These are based on the
[questions to frame a problem](https://www.hollidazed.co.uk/2015/07/28/frame-the-problem)
that [Ben Holiday](https://twitter.com/BenHolliday) wrote about, the
[discovery inception categories](https://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/setting-up-a-discovery)
that [Will Myddelton](https://twitter.com/myddelton) described, along with some
of the roadmapping questions.

## Questions for discovery

1. **Why are we doing this work?**

   What is the motivation? What are we trying to do or decide? And why now? What
   is the trigger?

1. **Who are the users?**

   Are they members of the public, professionals or staff? What different
   groups, circumstances and behaviours might be important? Are they current or
   potential users?

1. **What organisations and stakeholders are involved?**

   What is their relationship to the work? What expectations and concerns might
   they have? How closely might they be involved? How might they help?

1. **What outcomes will users get?**

   What do we know about their intentions? What’s working that we might we build
   on? What problems might we solve? What unintended consequences might we
   create?

1. **What outcomes are we looking for?**

   What is the client organisation trying to achieve? What problems are they
   trying to solve? What are the other organisations and stakeholders looking to
   get? What external costs and impacts should we consider?

1. **What do we need to learn or prove?**

   What questions are we trying to answer? What do we need to know to make good
   decisions? What assumptions should we be testing? What might we already know?

1. **What do we need to communicate?**

   What meetings, governance and other processes do we need to feed into? What
   outputs might we expect to create? For who? How will we share them?

1. **What other work relates to this?**

   What has been done before, or is being done now? What can we learn from each
   other? What should we share? How do we stay aligned with that work?

1. **What difficulties might we face?**

   How might we be blocked? What rabbit holes could we fall down?

## Asking the questions

To prepare the room:

1. Write each question on a separate sheet of paper or at the top of a piece of
   flip chart paper.
1. Stick them up on a wall so that everyone can see them.

For each question sheet:

1. Ask the question to get a discussion started.
1. Write bullet points on the appropriate sheet or on sticky notes to summarise
   what people say.
1. Ask follow up questions to clarify what you hear and to make sure you include
   everyone’s thoughts.
1. Ask about priority and scope. What’s essential? And what’s out of scope?
1. You can facilitate this on your own, but the first few times you might want
   to have a separate moderator and scribe. And it always helps to have another
   colleague in the crowd who is focussed on listening and picking up on
   anything you miss.

It’s best to put all the questions up together. The things people say in the
discussion will often relate to more than one question – for example, people
often mention outcomes for the organisation when they talk about why we’re doing
the work. With all the sheets up you can add bullet points to the appropriate
sheet.

This method works well for groups up to 10 and typically takes 90 minutes to 2
hours.

## Managing the session

When you invite stakeholders to the workshop, aim to get a good mix of senior
decision makers with a broad understanding of context and outcomes, together
with colleagues who have more practical and detailed knowledge. Aim to cover the
key interest groups so nobody is left feeling unrepresented.

Some people you invite may not see the point of the workshop. They may feel that
you have all the necessary information in the documents you’ve received. Or that
you’ve discussed the important points already.

Sharing the questions in advance can help people to understand the purpose of
the session and to prepare for it. Make sure you acknowledge what you’ve
received and discussed already, so people don’t feel like you’ve ignored all
that.

I always say that we haven’t got long for the discovery. We want to hear from
everyone, to make sure we’re focussing on the right things, so they get the most
out of the work.

During the session, most people will be happy to talk – this is something
they’re interested in and know loads about. So you’ll need to manage the session
closely to make sure you get through all the questions in a reasonable amount of
time.

The questions and workshop format are good for uncovering different opinions,
conflicting objectives, unrealistic expectations, etc. It’s good to note those
things during the session so everyone knows there are different viewpoints. But
don’t make a big deal of it and derail your own meeting. It’s a discovery and
part of the point is to identify those differences and help resolve them into
something more coherent.

## Using the workshop outputs

The question sheets create ready-made outputs from the workshop. You can
transcribe the points you collect into a document, or into another tool like
Trello or Miro.

From there you can use the answers to:

1. Set overall discovery and first sprint goals.
1. Plan the discovery activities – including stakeholder engagement, desk
   research, user research, business process analysis and journey mapping.
1. Build an initial map of the problem space to define a scope for the
   discovery.
1. Start thinking about the possible shape of the discovery outputs.
