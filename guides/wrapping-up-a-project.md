title: Wrapping up a project
---

## Why is this important?

We often only work with a client for a short period of time. But they may rely
on the things that we deliver long after we have moved on. This applies to work
we deliver during Discovery and Alpha (other teams and suppliers may need to
build on our work) or Beta and Live (services that we have helped launch will
need to be maintained).

Wrapping up a project well also helps us keep a good relationship with people
and organisations that we work with. Leaving a client happy makes it more likely
that they will want to work with us in future.

Finally, this is also a good opportunity to reflect on how the project has gone
as a whole. How successful have we been at achieving the outcomes we wanted to?
What do we want to build on or change for future projects?

## What do you need to think about?

- What needs to be handed over or maintained? Where are you in the project
  life-cycle?
- Does the team need to create anything as part of the wrap-up?
- Who is going to be the owner for this work once you leave? Who are you handing
  things over to?

## Checklist

### Penultimate sprint (or earlier)

- Revisit the scope and make sure you’ve done everything you needed to
- If a support contract is in place, make sure you follow the
  [guide to getting a project ready for support](/guides/getting-a-project-ready-for-support).

### Final sprint

- Run a whole project retro
- Check client has access to any documents or key pieces of information that
  they might need in the future. Make this tidy to help them find things later
  on. e.g. user research outputs or technical documentation

### Final week

- Write a note to everyone who worked on the project. Use this to celebrate the
  work that has been done, and to look forward to what happens next.
- Meet with client to close down the project and make sure they are happy. Are
  there other opportunities that we can support them on?
- Get feedback from the client.
- Get email confirmation from the client that the project has wrapped up.
