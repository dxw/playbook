title: Learning and development
---

We have an annual learning and development allowance of £1,000 and up to 4 days
per person.

You can use this in many different ways for professional and personal
development activities. Some ideas include workshops, short courses,
conferences, coaching, subscriptions and memberships but don’t be afraid to ask
if you have an idea we haven’t tried yet.

You can also use the allowance to attend a non role based conference or event
focused on improving your health and wellbeing. You will receive two days off
for this, and can top up the time from your annual leave allowance.

We know that lots of training isn’t paid for, and involves things like coaching
and mentoring, learning from colleagues, being an active part of networks, and
other self-directed learning. We will encourage and support people who want to
use unbilled days for different types of professional development.

## How to use your learning and development allowance

### Find an activity to book

Finding the right thing to use the allowance for can be difficult. Here are some
ways you can find ideas:

- Check the
  [Learning and development bikeshed post](https://bikeshed.dxw.com/?p=13876) to
  see what other people have done this year
- Ask other people on your team what they've done
- Talk to your line manager, who can help you identify potential areas for
  development and find suitable events or training
- Ask the HR team for ideas

### Book the activity

- Agree the plan with your line manager before you book anything
- Log it in [Breathe](https://hr.breathehr.com/) as a training request for your
  line manager to approve:
  - Go to "My profile" on the top menu
  - Click the "Training" button
  - Click the "+" button to add a new request
  - Include weblinks and an estimate of the ticket, accommodation and travel
    costs (up to the maximum of £1,000, though you are welcome to pay the
    difference for more expensive events)
- Once it’s approved, post in the #dxw-learning-and-development-bookings channel
  if you would like support with payment. You can also purchase yourself and
  make an expense claim
- Think about sharing event with the rest of your team if it's something other
  people might find relevant/useful
- Add to your Google calendar and make sure your project team know when you're
  going to be away

### After you get back

- Take some time to reflect on what you learnt, and (if appropriate) how it
  applies to your work at dxw
- Update the latest yearly
  [Learning and Development bikeshed post](https://bikeshed.dxw.com/?p=13876)
  with details of the event
- Consider writing a standalone bikeshed post giving more details about the
  event and how you found it

### If you need help

- Contact the HR team, or ask a question in Slack
  (#dxw-learning-and-development-bookings)

### The small print

dxw pays for the event ticket, travel, and accommodation, but you will need to
cover your own costs for food, drink and supplementary equipment.

The allowance is available to everyone once they have completed their probation
period, within the dxw financial year which runs from the start of July to end
June. It is pro-rata for staff who work part-time.

If you don’t spend your allowance within the financial year, it cannot be
carried over. We will start afresh each year, as part of our annual budgeting
cycle.

Your allowance is counted as being spent at the time of purchase rather than at
time of use. For example, if you buy a conference ticket in May for an event in
July the same year, the deduction will be made to the budget for the financial
year that May falls within.

Attending conferences and events that are not related to your role is a taxable
benefit. As your employer, we will make the declaration, HMRC will then adjust
your tax code accordingly to collect the tax via PAYE.

It’s ok for members of the team to go together, but we need to ensure that
training days have the lowest impact on client work, so there may be times we
need to consider whether your request is possible. Our Director of Delivery will
help with prioritisation in those circumstances.

At the end of each financial year we will review our financial position with the
intention of increasing the annual allowance.

## Support for professional qualifications

We may pay for a qualification or training that exceeds the annual £1,000
individual learning and development allowance, when that course is relevant and
helpful to both dxw and the individual. This is a benefit that comes into effect
once you have passed your probationary period.

We will agree to pay on the understanding that if you leave dxw, you may be
liable to repay some or all of the fees and expenses incurred.

Other than in exceptional circumstances, which will be decided at the Directors’
discretion, you will be required to repay dxw as follows:

- If you leave dxw before you attend the course, you will repay 100% of the
  costs that dxw cannot recover from the course provider.
- If you leave dxw during the course or within 9 months of completing it, you
  will repay 75% of the costs.
- If you leave dxw more than 9 months and no more than 12 months after
  completing the course, you will repay 50% of the costs.
- If you leave dxw more than 12 months after completing the course, no repayment
  will be required.

We appreciate that these percentages won’t always work given the length of the
qualification, and so the final percentage will be at the discretion of the
Directors and will be agreed with the individual prior to approval of the
course.

You will not be required to repay any costs in the following circumstances:

- Compulsory or voluntary redundancy
- Retirement due to sickness

from dxw to complete a professional qualification.
