title: Junior developer development plan
---

## High level goals

Before a junior developer can be promoted, they need to be:

- independently productive
- billable as a developer

## Support

A junior developer has the following direct support:

- a mentor (for development related help and guidance)
- a helper (for dxw / ways of working related help and guidance)
- a line manager (for everything else)

They are also supported by individual teams and the technology team as a whole.

## Planned stages

1. Shadowing a project
1. Creating an internal service
1. Joining a team (short-term)
1. Shadowing support
1. Joining a team (long-term)

### Shadowing a project

Within the first couple of weeks of joining, junior developers starting at dxw,
they should start a 4 to 6 week full-time period shadowing an ongoing project
each (not the same one), alongside general dxw onboarding. An ideal project
would:

- be based where they are
- have 3 or more people in technical roles working on it

One person on the project should be assigned as the point of contact, but the
junior developer should shadow a range of team members, focusing on technical
roles, but also other members of the team. The goal of this is to give them a
low pressure situation to see how dxw does things, and hopefully pick up some
good practices.

### Creating an internal service

After shadowing, junior developers should spend 4 weeks working on an internal
service. This might be creating a new service (entirely new or a new version),
or adding features to an existing one. It should involve the following
additional team members / roles as part-time support (possibly drawn from the
support rota):

- delivery lead
- developer
- operations engineer
- product owner

This project should be treated in the same way as we do client projects, with a
Trello board, sprints, stand ups, planning sessions, retrospectives, and show
and tells.

A good candidate project:

- is one built in the stack the Junior Developers are specializing in
- has clear, well-defined user needs
- is brand new or in a clean state with tests for existing features
- has or needs a browser-based interface
- can produce something useful for users in 4 weeks by junior developers

Junior developers should be encouraged to pair with each other and with other
developers in the technology team and to use this project to get familiar with
dxw’s ways of working, and practice some of the skills they’ll use in the
future.

### Joining a team (short-term)

Next, each junior developer should join a client project team for 8 to 10 weeks,
unbilled. This team should contain at least 2 full-time technology team members,
and will ideally be in the beta phase. The junior developers should be
considered full members of the team. They should be expected to be able to pick
up well defined routine or simple tasks in the sprint, mostly on their own, but
with some support from other developers. The teams should ensure that they have
well-shaped tasks set aside for the junior developer to take on, and should be
thinking about this in advance of the junior developer joining the project.

Junior developers should do client work for 3 days a week. The remaining 2 days
a week should be spent working on anything that comes up as areas to focus on
during client work, or any skills they’re unable to exercise on the project.

### Shadowing support

Within the first 4 months of joining dxw, a junior developer should shadow a
developer on the support rota for a full support shift. During this time, they
should be included in triaging, responding to tickets, and any support
development work. They should also pair with the developer on any “filler” work
they do during quiet moments.

They should shadow a shift again within the next 4 months, ideally shadowing a
different developer. After their second shadowed shift, they should be added to
the support rota.

### Joining a team (long-term)

Once a junior developer has spent a decent amount of time working on a client
project, as well as working on their own development, they should ideally join a
different project team with at least 2 full-time technology team members for 3
days a week for a longer period of time: at least 3 months. This might not
always be possible, but priority should be given to creating continuity to allow
them to get settled and fully understand the needs of the service they’re
working on.

After a month on the project, the team should review how the junior developer is
doing on the team, to establish whether they could start to be billed for that
work. This review should consider that the value proposition of billing a junior
developer is long-term. It may cost the client a little more in the short-term,
but that value will be made up as the junior developer progresses and gains
familiarity with the service and the team.

It isn’t a requirement that a junior developer be billed at this point, and
shouldn’t be considered pressure on the team or junior developer, but more an
evaluation of how much value they’re delivering for the client. This should be
repeated every 4-6 weeks, so we can ensure that their continued progression is
properly recognized.
