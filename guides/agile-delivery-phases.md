title: Agile delivery phases
---

In 2011, the UK government established the Government Digital Service (GDS) to
implement the ‘Digital by Default’ strategy proposed by Martha Lane Fox. GDS and
the ‘Digital by Default’ strategy intended to revolutionise the way citizens
interact with public services and government departments. Central to GDS’
approach is the Service Manual. The Service Manual provides guidance and support
to public sector organisations for creating and running better digital services.

The Service Manual describes how an [agile approach](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
to delivering projects can lead to better digital services.

The core principles of an agile approach are:

- Focus on user needs
- Deliver iteratively
- Keep improving how your team works
- Fail fast and learn quickly
- Responding to change over following a plan

The Service Manual describes four stages of agile delivery:

- Discovery
- Alpha
- Beta
- Live

## Discovery

Before committing to building something, we need to understand what the user
needs are and if a new thing is needed. This is **discovery**.

Discovery de-risks the future. It allows us to understand the scope of a problem
and the best way to proceed in response.

Activities in discovery include:

- User research
- Analysis of business needs
- Market research
- Journey mapping
- Cost analysis

**We are not building software in discovery.** The outputs of a discovery
include:

- Recommendations on the best way to proceed.
- A prioritised list of user needs that future development work can be planned
  against.
- Findings about current processes or the existing service.
- Estimated scale and costs for developing a new service.

## Alpha

After committing to building a new service, we need to understand how it will
work for users and how it will integrate with existing processes and systems.
**This is alpha.**

Alpha results in a better and more focused service. It allows us to understand
how users will interact with the service and what is technically possible.

Activities in alpha include:

- Building test designs or concepts
- User testing
- Service design
- Technical audit and exploration of existing and legacy systems

**We are usually not building software in alpha, even though it might look like
it.** The outputs of an alpha will include:

- Designs that have been tested and iterated with users.
- A roadmap and plan for a beta phase.
- Metrics to measure performance.
- Research findings in the form of user stories and journey maps.

## Beta

With a clear scope, user needs, and technical approach in place, we are ready to
build a working version of the service. **This is beta.**

Beta results in software that can handle real transactions and is ready to work
at scale. It allows us to develop better services that meet user needs.

Activities in beta include:

- Developing working software
- Testing and iterating
- Getting the service accredited
- Measuring performance
- Developing and testing a security approach

**We _are_ building software and technical infrastructure in beta.** The outputs
of a beta will include:

- Working software that is being used for real transactions
- Technical infrastructure to support the new service
- Metrics about the performance of the service
- A backlog of development tasks for ongoing iterations
- An approach for security

## Live

Once a service is being used for real transactions, continuous improvements can
be made based on feedback, research and data. **This is live.**

An active digital service is never ‘done’. The live phase allows us to respond
to change and new research findings in order to keep iterating the service.

Activities in live include:

- Iterating and improving the service
- Measuring performance
- User support
- Testing the service for security

**We are continuously improving and supporting working software.** The outputs
of live will include:

- Iterations and improvements to the service
- Metrics on performance
- A backlog of development tasks for ongoing iterations
- Security tests

## Adapting our approach

Clients have different ways of working. They may not be familiar with the
Service Manual. Or they may have a slightly different approach to agile to us.

The principles behind the Service Manual should be consistently applied in any
project we deliver. But this doesn’t mean we need to follow a rigid, gated
process to get things done.

We can support our clients by:

- Explaining the content and value of the service manual
- Helping them understand terminology such as “sprint ceremonies”
- Coaching them to think about user needs, lead ceremonies, or work openly
- Helping them to apply the principles of the Service Manual in their own
  context
