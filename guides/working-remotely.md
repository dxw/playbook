title: Working remotely
---

When a delivery team aren't all in the same place, it's important that we
continue to communicate and collaborate as well as we can. This guide contains
some suggestions about how to create a happy and productive remote working
environment.

## Coming and going

When you arrive, go home, or leave your station for a while, let your teammates
know in Slack.

## Know the limits of your technology

Dialing in to a video conference is usually fine for standups, whereas things
like all-day workshops are more difficult. In those cases consider attending by
speakerphone, or not at all.

## Keep notes

If someone is not able to attend a meeting because they are working remotely,
they need to have some kind of report of that meeting in writing. The format
doesn't really matter - it could be a set of Trello cards, for instance.

If you need to write out a note, make it as concise as you can.

Be mindful that it is easy for a casual conversation around the office to turn
into an ad-hoc meeting. Recognise when this happens, and stop to include remote
team members.

## Drawings

If your conversation will be enhanced by drawings, try to have it in person. If
you can't, consider a low-tech solution like holding a sketch up to your webcam
or sharing a photo in Slack in preference to spending time making graphics on
the computer.
