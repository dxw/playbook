# Style guide

## General

In general:

- use as few words as you can to accurately say what you're saying
- prefer simple words over complicated ones
- avoid business-speak and overused idioms
- tone should avoid be overly formal, but not to the point of becoming colloquial
- break your work up into short paragraphs, and consider using subtitles and
  images to break up the text

## Punctuation

Do this:

- don't use hyphens to delineate bits of sentences -- like this. Instead, use
  commas, a colon, or parentheses
- capitalise proper nouns, words at the beginning of sentences, and
  (if appropriate) abbreviations and nothing else
- don't capitalise every word in a title
- avoid semicolons unless they are definitely right
- numbers should use commas: £1,000 not £1000
- dont get apostrophe's wrong or dxws' reputation will forever be ruined

## Tone

Do this:

- always remember our values: in particular, making sure we're helpful and
  positive
- don't say things like _"we're experts in WordPress"_. Instead, say things show
  that that sentiment is true (for example we've hosted some large sites for
  important folk)
- make factual statements about the customer rather than our understanding of
  them:
  - _"You've said that"_ rather than _"We assume that"_ or _
    "An assumption has been stated that"_
  - _"Your staff have experience administering WordPress"_ rather than
    _"We understand that your staff..."_

## Strongly discouraged words and phrases

It's fine to use these if they really are the best words to use, but be mindful
that they usually aren't. Some of these are cribbed from the

<!-- vale Dxw.TiredIdioms = NO -->

### Tired idioms

Do not use:

- in terms of (very rarely actually used to describe one thing in terms of
  another and is often a verbal tick which can usually just be omitted)
- look to
- with regards to
- separate out (the 'out' is redundant)
- we will aim to... (are we doing it or not?)

<!-- vale Dxw.TiredIdioms = YES -->

## A-Z

In addition to the list below, we also follow the [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style).
This gives lots of information about words and phrases specific to the public
sector.

<!-- vale Dxw.DigitalMarketplace = NO -->

**Digital Marketplace**: the government procurement website should be
capitalised as it is a proper noun to distinguish it from other digital
marketplaces (like eBay).

<!-- vale Dxw.DigitalMarketplace = YES -->

<!-- vale Dxw.Dxw = NO -->

**dxw**: in client-facing/public-facing documents, dxw should be lowercase.

<!-- vale Dxw.Dxw = YES -->

<!-- vale Dxw.GCloud = NO -->

**G-Cloud**: formatted thusly with hyphen and capital letters. Never 'G-cloud'
or 'g-cloud' or 'G Cloud' or 'GCloud'.

<!-- vale Dxw.GCloud = YES -->

<!-- vale Dxw.GovPress = NO -->

**GovPress**: not 'Govpress' or 'Gov Press'

<!-- vale Dxw.GovPress = YES -->

<!-- vale Dxw.multisite = NO -->

**multisite**: if referring to the feature directly, "Multisite" should be
capitalised. If referring to an multisite WordPress setup, "multisite". Never
"multi site" or "multi-site".

<!-- vale Dxw.multisite = YES -->

**open source**: always lower case.

<!-- vale Dxw.plugin = NO -->

**plugin**: not 'plug in' or 'plug-in'.

<!-- vale Dxw.plugin = YES -->

**Rails**: for the Ruby framework, always upcase. Lower case is fine for the
things trains run on.

<!-- vale Dxw.WordPress = NO -->

**WordPress**: not 'Word Press', 'Wordpress' or 'WP'.

<!-- vale Dxw.WordPress = YES -->

### Words to avoid

GOV.UK have a [list of words to avoid](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#words-to-avoid),
which we also follow. In addition:
